_ACTUS PRIMUS. SCENA PRIMA_.


_Enter a_ Merchant _and_ Herman.

_Mer._  Is he then taken?

_Her._ And brought back even now, Sir.

_Mer_. He was not in disgrace?

_Her_. No man more lov'd,
Nor more deserv'd it, being the only man
That durst be honest in this Court.

_Mer_. Indeed
We have heard abroad, Sir, that the State hath suffered
A great change, since the Countesses death.

_Her_. It hath, Sir.

_Mer_. My five years absence hath kept me a stranger
So much to all the occurents of my Country,
As you shall bind me for some short relation
To make me understand the present times.

_Her_. I must begin then with a War was made
And seven years with all cruelty continued
Upon our _Flanders_ by the Duke of _Brabant_,
The cause grew thus: during our Earls minority,
_Wolfort_, (who now usurps) was employed thither
To treat about a match between our Earl
And the Daughter and Heir of _Brabant_: during which treaty
The _Brabander_ pretends, this Daughter was
Stoln from his Court, by practice of our State,
Though we are all confirm'd, 'twas a sought quarrel
To lay an unjust gripe upon this Earldom,
It being here believ'd the Duke of _Brabant_
Had no such loss. This War upon't proclaimed,
Our Earl, being then a Child, although his Father
Good _Gerrard_ liv'd, yet in respect he was
Chosen by the Countesses favour, for her Husband,
And but a Gentleman, and _Florez_ holding
His right unto this Country from his Mother,
The State thought fit in this defensive War,
_Wolfort_ being then the only man of mark,
To make him General.

_Mer_. Which place we have heard
He did discharge with ho[n]our.

_Her_. I, so long,
And with so blest successes, that the _Brabander_
Was forc't (his treasures wasted, and the choice
Of his best men of Armes tyr'd, or cut off)
To leave the field, and sound a base retreat
Back to his Country: but so broken both
In mind and means, er'e to make head again,
That hitherto he sits down by his loss,
Not daring, or for honour, or revenge
Again to tempt his fortune. But this Victory
More broke our State, and made a deeper hurt
In _Flanders_, than the greatest overthrow
She ever receiv'd: For _Wolfort_, now beholding
Himself, and actions, in the flattering glass
Of self-deservings, and that cherish't by
The strong assurance of his power, for then
All Captains of the Army were his creatures,
The common Souldier too at his devotion,
Made so by full indulgence to their rapines
And secret bounties, this strength too well known
And what it could effect, soon put in practice,
As further'd by the Child-hood of the Earl:
And their improvidence, that might have pierc't
The heart of his designs, gave him occasion
To seize the whole, and in that plight you find it.

_Mer_. Sir, I receive the knowledge of thus much,
As a choice favour from you.

_Her_. Only I must add,
_Bruges_ holds out.

_Mer_. Whither, Sir, I am going,
For there last night I had a ship put in,
And my Horse waits me.            [_Exit_.

_Her_. I wish you a good journey.

_Enter_ Wolfort, Hubert.

_Wol_. What? _Hubert_ stealing from me? who disarm'd him?
It was more than I commanded; take your sword,
I am best guarded with it in your hand,
I have seen you use it nobly.

_Hub_. And will turn it
On my own bosom, ere it shall be drawn
Unworthily or rudely.

_Wol_. Would you leave me
Without a farewel, _Hubert_? flie a friend
Unwearied in his study to advance you?
What have I e're possess'd which was not yours?
Or either did not court you to command it?
Who ever yet arriv'd to any grace,
Reward or trust from me, but his approaches
Were by your fair reports of him prefer'd?
And what is more I made my self your Servant,
In making you the Master of those secrets
Which not the rack of Conscience could draw from me,
Nor I, when I askt mercy, trust my prayers with;
Yet after these assurances of love,
These tyes and bonds of friendship, to forsake me?
Forsake me as an enemy? come you must
Give me a reason.

_Hub_. Sir, and so I will,
If I may do't in private: and you hear it.

_Wol_. All leave the room: you have your will, sit down
And use the liberty of our first friendship.

_Hub_. Friendship? when you prov'd Traitor first, that vanish'd,
Nor do I owe you any thought, but hate,
I know my flight hath forfeited my head;
And so I may make you first understand
What a strange monster you have made your self,
I welcome it.

_Wol_. To me this is strange language.

_Hub_. To you? why what are you?

_Wol_. Your Prince and Master,
The Earl of _Flanders_.

Hub. By a proper title!
Rais'd to it by cunning, circumvention, force,
Blood, and proscriptions.

_Wol_. And in all this wisdom,
Had I not reason? when by _Gerrards_ plots
I should have first been call'd to a strict accompt
How, and which way I had consum'd that mass
Of money, as they term it, in the War,
Who underhand had by his Ministers
Detracted my great action, made my faith
And loyalty suspected, in which failing
He sought my life by practice.

_Hub_. With what fore-head
Do you speak this to me? who (as I know't)
Must, and will say 'tis false.

_Wol_. My Guard there.

_Hub_. Sir, you bad me sit, and promis'd you would hear,
Which I now say you shall; not a sound more,
For I that am contemner of mine own,
Am Master of your life; then here's a Sword
Between you, and all aids, Sir, though you blind
The credulous beast, the multitude, you pass not
These gross untruths on me.

_Wol_. How? gross untruths?

_Hub_. I, and it is favourable language,
They had been in a mean man lyes, and foul ones.

_Wol_. You take strange Licence.

_Hub_. Yes, were not those rumours
Of being called unto your answer, spread
By your own followers? and weak _Gerrard_ wrought
(But by your cunning practice) to believe
That you were dangerous; yet not to be
Punish'd by any formal course of Law,
But first to be made sure, and have your crimes
Laid open after, which your quaint train taking
You fled unto the Camp, and [there] crav'd humbly
Protection for your innocent life, and that,
Since you had scap'd the fury of the War,
You might not fall by treason: and for proof,
You did not for your own ends make this danger;
Some that had been before by you suborn'd,
Came forth and took their Oaths they had been hir'd
By _Gerrard_ to your Murther. This once heard,
And easily believ'd, th'inraged Souldier
Seeing no further than the outward-man,
Snatch'd hastily his Arms, ran to the Court,
Kill'd all that made resistance, cut in pieces
Such as were Servants, or thought friends to _Gerrard_,
Vowing the like to him.

_Wol_. Will you yet end?

_Hub_. Which he foreseeing, with his Son, the Earl,
Forsook the City; and by secret wayes
As you give out, and we would gladly have it,
Escap'd their fury: though 'tis more than fear'd
They fell amongst the rest; Nor stand you there
To let us only mourn the impious means
By which you got it, but your cruelties since
So far transcend your former bloody ills,
As if compar'd, they only would appear
Essays of mischief; do not stop your ears,
More are behind yet.

_Wol_. O repeat them not,
'Tis Hell to hear them nam'd.

_Hub_. You should have thought,
That Hell would be your punishment when you did them,
A Prince in nothing but your princely lusts,
And boundless rapines.

_Wol_. No more I beseech you.

_Hub_. Who was the Lord of house or land, that stood
Within the prospect of your covetous eye?

_Wol_. You are in this to me a greater Tyrant,
Than e're I was to any.

_Hub_. I end thus
The general grief: now to my private wrong;
The loss of _Gerrards_ Daughter _Jaqueline_:
The hop'd for partner of my lawful Bed,
Your cruelty hath frighted from mine arms;
And her I now was wandring to recover.
Think you that I had reason now to leave you,
When you are grown so justly odious,
That ev'n my stay here with your grace and favour,
Makes my life irksome? here, surely take it,
And do me but this fruit of all your friendship,
That I may dye by you, and not your Hang-man.

_Wol_. Oh _Hubert_, these your words and reasons have
As well drawn drops of blood from my griev'd heart,
As these tears from mine eyes;
Despise them not.
By all that's sacred, I am serious, _Hubert_,
You now have made me sensible, what furies,
Whips, Hangmen, and Tormentors a bad man
Do's ever bear about him: let the good
That you this day have done, be ever number'd
The first of your best actions;
Can you think,
Where _Goswin_ is or _Gerrard_, or your love,
Or any else, or all that are proscrib'd?
I will resign, what I usurp, or have
Unjustly forc'd; the dayes I have to live
Are too too few to make them satisfaction
With any penitence: yet I vow to practise
All of a man.

_Hub_. O that your heart and tongue
Did not now differ!

_Wol_. By my griefs they do not.
Take the good pains to search them out: 'tis worth it,
You have made clean a Leper: trust me you have,
And made me once more fit for the society,
I hope of good men.

_Hub_. Sir, do not abuse
My aptness to believe.

_Wol_. Suspect not you
A faith that's built upon so true a sorrow,
Make your own safetys: ask them all the ties
Humanity can give, _Hemskirk_ too shall
Along with you to this so wish'd discovery,
And in my name profess all that you promise;
And I will give you this help to't: I have
Of late receiv'd certain intelligence,
That some of them are in or about _Bruges_
To be found out: which I did then interpret,
The cause of that Towns standing out against me;
But now am glad, it may direct your purpose
Of giving them their safety, and me peace.

_Hub_. Be constant to your goodness, and you have it.     [_Exeunt_.




SCENA II.


_Enter 3_. Merchants.

_1 Mer_. 'Tis much that you deliver of this _Goswin_.

_2 Mer_. But short of what I could, yet have the Country
Confirm'd it true, and by a general oath,
And not a man hazard his credit in it:
He bears himself with such a confidence
As if he were the Master of the Sea,
And not a wind upon the Sailers compass,
But from one part or other was his factor,
To bring him in the best commodities,
Merchant e're ventur'd for.

1. 'Tis strange.

2.  And yet
This do's in him deserve the least of wonder,
Compared with other his peculiar fashions,
Which all admire: he's young, and rich, at least
Thus far reputed so, that since he liv'd
In _Bruges_, there was never brought to harbour
So rich a Bottom, but his bill would pass
Unquestion'd for her lading.

3 _Mer._ Yet he still
Continues a good man.

2 _Mer._ So good, that but
To doubt him, would be held an injury
Or rather malice, with the best that traffique;
But this is nothing, a great stock, and fortune,
Crowning his judgement in his undertakings
May keep him upright that way: But that wealth
Should want the power to make him dote on it,
Or youth teach him to wrong it, best commends
His constant temper; for his outward habit
'Tis suitable to his present course of life:
His table furnish'd well, but not with dainties
That please the appetite only for their rareness,
Or their dear price: nor given to wine or women,
Beyond his health, or warrant of a man,
I mean a good one: and so loves his state
He will not hazard it at play; nor lend
Upon the assurance of a well-pen'd Letter,
Although a challenge second the denial
From such as make th' opinion of their valour
Their means of feeding.

1 _Mer._ These are wayes to thrive,
And the means not curs'd.

2 _Mer._ What follows, this
Makes many venturers with him, in their wishes,
For his prosperity: for when desert
Or reason leads him to be liberal,
His noble mind and ready hand contend
Which can add most to his free courtesies,
Or in their worth, or speed to make them so.
Is there a Virgin of good fame wants dower?
He is a Father to her; or a Souldier
That in his Countreys service, from the war
Hath brought home only scars, and want? his house
Receives him, and relieves him, with that care
As if what he possess'd had been laid up
For such good uses, and he steward of it.
But I should lose my self to speak him further
And stale in my relation, the much good
You may be witness of, if your remove
From _Bruges_ be not speedy.

1 _Mer._ This report
I do assure you will not hasten it,
Nor would I wish a better man to deal with
For what I am to part with.

3 _Mer._ Never doubt it,
He is your man and ours, only I wish
His too much forwardness to embrace all bargains
Sink him not in the end.

2 _Mer._ Have better hopes,
For my part I am confident; here he comes.

_Enter_ Goswin, _and the fourth_ Merchant.

_Gos._ I take it at your own rates, your wine of _Cyprus_,
But for your _Candy_ sugars, they have met
With such foul weather, and are priz'd so high
I cannot save in them.

4 _Mer._ I am unwilling
To seek another Chapman: make me offer
Of something near price, that may assure me
You can deal for them.

_Gos._ I both can, and will,
But not with too much loss; your bill of lading
Speaks of two hundred chests, valued by you
At thirty thousand gilders, I will have them
At twenty eight; so, in the payment of
Three thousand sterling, you fall only in
Two hundred pound.

4 _Mer_. You know, they are so cheap.--

_Gos_. Why look you; I'le deal fa[ir]ly, there's in prison,
And at your suit, a Pirat, but unable
To make you satisfaction, and past hope
To live a week, if you should prosecute
What you can prove against him: set him free,
And you shall have your mony to a Stiver,
And present payment.

4 _Mer_. This is above wonder,
A Merchant of your rank, that have at Sea
So many Bottoms in the danger of
These water-Thieves, should be a means to save 'em,
It more importing you for your own safety
To be at charge to scour the Sea of them
Than stay the sword of justice, that is ready
To fall on one so conscious of his guilt
That he dares not deny it.

_Gos_. You mistake me,
If you think I would cherish in this Captain
The wrong he did to you, or any man;
I was lately with him, (having first, from others
True testimony been assured a man
Of more desert never put from the shore)
I read his letters of Mart from this State granted
For the recovery of such losses, as
He had receiv'd in _Spain_, 'twas that he aim'd at,
Not at three tuns of wine, bisket, or beef,
Which his necessity made him take from you.
If he had pillag'd you near, or sunk your ship,
Or thrown your men o'r-board, then he deserv'd
The Laws extreamest rigour. But since want
Of what he could not live without, compel'd him
To that he did (which yet our State calls death)
I pity his misfortune; and to work you
To some compassion of them, I come up
To your own price: save him, the goods are mine;
If not, seek else-where, I'le not deal for them.

_4 Mer_. Well Sir, for your love, I will once be led
To change my purpose.

_Gos_. For your profit rather.

_4 Mer_. I'le presently make means for his discharge,
Till when, I leave you.

_2 Mer_. What do you think of this?

_1 Mer_. As of a deed of noble pity: guided
By a strong judgement.

_2 Mer_. Save you Master _Goswin_.

_Goswin_. Good day to all.

_2 Mer_. We bring you the refusal
Of more Commodities.

_Gos_. Are you the owners
Of the ship that last night put into the Harbour?

_1 Mer_. Both of the ship, and lading.

_Gos_. What's the fraught?

_1 Mer_. _Indico, Cochineel_, choise _Chyna_ stuffs.

_3 Mer_. And cloath of Gold brought from _Cambal_.

_Gos_. Rich lading,
For which I were your Chapman, but I am
Already out of cash.

_1 Mer_. I'le give you day
For the moiety of all.

_Gos_. How long?

_3 Mer_. Six months.

_Gos_. 'Tis a fair offer: which (if we agree
About the prices) I, with thanks accept of,
And will make present payment of the rest;
Some two hours hence I'le come aboard.

_1 Mer_. The Gunner shall speak you welcom.

_Gos_. I'le not fail.

_3 Mer_. Good morrow.              [_Ex_. Merch.

_Gos_. Heaven grant my Ships a safe return, before
The day of this great payment: as they are
Expected three months sooner: and my credit
Stands good with all the world.

_Enter_ Gerrard.

_Ger_. Bless my good Master,
The prayers of your poor Beads-man ever shall
Be sent up for you.

_Gos_. God o' mercy _Clause_,
There's something to put thee in mind hereafter
To think of me.

_Ger_. May he that gave it you
Reward you for it, with encrease, good Master.

_Gos_. I thrive the better for thy prayers.

_Ger_. I hope so.
This three years have I fed upon your bounties,
And by the fire of your blest charity warm'd me,
And yet, good Master, pardon me, that must,
Though I have now receiv'd your alms, presume
To make one sute more to you.

_Gos_. What is't _Clause_?

_Ger_. Yet do not think me impudent I beseech you,
Since hitherto your charity hath prevented
My begging your relief, 'tis not for mony
Nor cloaths (good Master) but your good word for me.

_Gos_. That thou shalt have, _Clause_, for I think thee honest.

_Ger_. To morrow then (dear M'r.) take the trouble
Of walking early unto _Beggars Bush_,
And as you see me, among others (Brethren
In my affliction) when you are demanded
Which you like best among us, point out me,
And then pass by, as if you knew me not.

_Gos_. But what will that advantage thee?

_Ger_. O much Sir,
'Twill give me the preheminence of the rest,
Make me a King among 'em, and protect me
From all abuse, such as are stronger, might
Offer my age; Sir, at your better leisure
I will inform you further of the good
It may do to me.

_Gos_. 'Troth thou mak'st me wonder;
Have you a King and common-wealth among you?

_Ger_. We have, and there are States are govern'd worse.

_Gos_. Ambition among Beggars?

_Ger_. Many great ones
Would part with half their states, to have the place,
And credit to beg in the first file, Master:
But shall I be so much bound to your furtherance
In my Petition?

_Gos._ That thou shalt not miss of,
Nor any worldly care make me forget it,
I will be early there.

_Ger._ Heaven bless my Master.       [_Exeunt_.




_ACTUS SECUNDUS. SCENA PRIMA._


_Enter_ Higgen, Ferret, Prig, Clause, Jaculine,
Snap, Ginks, _and other beggars_.

_Hig._ Come Princes of the ragged regiment,
You o' the blood, _Prig_ my most upright Lord,
And these (what name or title, e're they bear)
_Jarkman_, or _Patrico_, _Cranke_, or _Clapperdudgeon_,
_Frater_, or _Abram-man_; I speak to all
That stand in fair Election for the title
Of King of _Beggars_, with the command adjoyning,
_Higgen_, your Orator, in this Inter-regnum,
That whilom was your Dommerer, doth beseech you
All to stand fair, and put your selves in rank,
That the first Comer, may at his first view
Make a free choice, to say up the question.

_Fer. Pr._ 'Tis done Lord _Higgen_.

_Hig._ Thanks to Prince _Prig_, Prince _Ferret_.

_Fer._ Well, pray my Masters all, _Ferret_ be chosen,
Y'are like to have a mercifull mild Prince of me.

_Prig._ A very tyrant, I, an arrant tyrant,
If e're I come to reign; therefore look to't,
Except you do provide me hum enough
And Lour to bouze with: I must have my Capons
And Turkeys brought me in, with my green Geese,
And Ducklings i'th' season: fine fat chickens,
Or if you chance where an eye of tame Phesants
Or Partridges are kept, see they be mine,
Or straight I seize on all your priviledge,
Places, revenues, offices, as forfeit,
Call in your crutches, wooden legs, false bellyes,
Forc'd eyes and teeth, with your dead arms; not leave you
A durty clout to beg with o' your heads,
Or an old rag with Butter, Frankincense,
Brimston and Rozen, birdlime, blood, and cream,
To make you an old sore; not so much soap
As you may fome with i'th' Falling-sickness;
The very bag you bear, and the brown dish
Shall be escheated. All your daintiest Dells too
I will deflower, and take your dearest Doxyes
From your warm sides; and then some one cold night
I'le watch you what old barn you go to roost in,
And there I'le smother you all i'th' musty hay.

_Hig._ This is tyrant-like indeed: But what would _Ginks_
Or _Clause_ be here, if either of them should raign?

_Clau._ Best ask an Ass, if he were made a Camel,
What he would be; or a dog, and he were a Lyon.

_Ginks._ I care not what you are, Sirs, I shall be
A Beggar still I am sure, I find my self there.

_Enter_ Goswin.

_Snap._ O here a Judge comes.

_Hig._ Cry, a Judge, a Judge.

_Gos._ What ail you Sirs? what means this outcry?

_Hig._ Master,
A sort of poor souls met: Gods fools, good Master,
Have had some little variance amongst our selves
Who should be honestest of us, and which lives
Uprightest in his calling: Now, 'cause we thought
We ne're should 'gree on't our selves, because
Indeed 'tis hard to say: we all dissolv'd, to put it
To him that should come next, and that's your Master-ship,
Who, I hope, will 'termine it as your mind serves you,
Right, and no otherwise we ask it: which?
Which does your worship think is he? sweet Master
Look over us all, and tell us; we are seven of us,
Like to the seven wise Masters, or the Planets.

_Gos._ I should judge this the man with the grave beard,
And if he be not--

_Clau._ Bless you, good Master, bless you.

_Gos._ I would he were: there's something too amongst you
To keep you all honest.            [_Exit._

_Snap._ King of Heaven go with you.

_Omn._ Now good reward him,
May he never want it, to comfort still the poor, in a good hour.

_Fer._ What is't? see: _Snap_ has got it.

_Snap._ A good crown, marry.

_Prig._ A crown of gold.

_Fer._ For our new King: good luck.

_Ginks._ To the common treasury with it; if't be gold,
Thither it must.

_Prig._ Spoke like a Patriot, _Ferret_--
King _Clause_, I bid God save thee first, first, _Clause_,
After this golden token of a crown;
Where's oratour _Higgen_ with his gratuling speech now
In all our names?

_Fer._ Here he is pumping for it.

_Gin._ H'has cough'd the second time, 'tis but once more
And then it comes.

_Fer._ So, out with all: expect now--

_Hig._ That thou art chosen, venerable _Clause_,
Our King and Soveraign; Monarch o'th'Maunders,
Thus we throw up our Nab-cheats, first for joy,
And then our filches; last, we clap our fambles,
Three subject signs, we do it without envy:
For who is he here did not wish thee chosen,
Now thou art chosen? ask 'em: all will say so,
Nay swear't: 'tis for the King, but let that pass.
When last in conference at the bouzing ken
This other day we sat about our dead Prince
Of famous memory: (rest go with his rags:)
And that I saw thee at the tables end,
Rise mov'd, and gravely leaning on one Crutch,
Lift the other like a Scepter at my head,
I then presag'd thou shortly wouldst be King,
And now thou art so: but what need presage
To us, that might have read it in thy beard
As well, as he that chose thee? by that beard
Thou wert found out, and mark'd for Soveraignty.
O happy beard! but happier Prince, whose beard
Was so remark'd, as marked out our Prince,
Not bating us a hair. Long may it grow,
And thick, and fair, that who lives under it,
May live as safe, as under _Beggars Bush_,
Of which this is the thing, that but the type.

_Om._ Excellent, excellent orator, forward good _Higgen_,
Give him leave to spit: the fine, well-spoken _Higgen_.

_Hig._ This is the beard, the bush, or bushy-beard,
Under whose gold and silver raign 'twas said
So many ages since, we all should smile
On impositions, taxes, grievances,
Knots in a State, and whips unto a Subject,
Lye lurking in this beard, but all kemb'd out:
If now, the Beard be such, what is the Prince
That owes the Beard? a Father; no, a Grand-father;
Nay the great Grand-father of you his people.
He will not force away your hens, your bacon,
When you have ventur'd hard for't, nor take from you
The fattest of your puddings: under him
Each man shall eat his own stolen eggs, and butter,
In his own shade, or sun-shine, and enjoy
His own dear Dell, Doxy, or Mort, at night
In his own straw, with his own shirt, or sheet,
That he hath filch'd that day, I, and possess
What he can purchase, back, or belly-cheats
To his own prop: he will have no purveyers
For Pigs, and poultry.

_Clau._ That we must have, my learned oratour,
It is our will, and every man to keep
In his own path and circuit.

_Hig._ Do you hear?
You must hereafter maund on your own pads he saies.

_Clau._ And what they get there, is their own, besides
To give good words.

_Hig._ Do you mark? to cut been whids,
That is the second Law.

_Clau._ And keep a-foot
The humble, and the common phrase of begging,
Lest men discover us.

_Hig._ Yes; and cry sometimes,
To move compassion: Sir, there is a table,
That doth command all these things, and enjoyns 'em,
Be perfect in their crutches, their feign'd plaisters,
And their torn pass-ports, with the ways to stammer,
And to be dumb, and deaf, and blind, and lame,
There, all the halting paces are set down,
I'th' learned language.

_Clau._ Thither I refer them,
Those, you at leisure shall interpret to them.
We love no heaps of laws, where few will serve.

_Om._ O gracious Prince, 'save, 'save the good King _Clause_.

_Hig._ A Song to crown him.

_Fer._ Set a Centinel out first.

_Snap._ The word?

_Hig._ A Cove comes, and fumbumbis to it.--     _Strike._

    _The SONG.

Cast our Caps and cares away: this is Beggars Holy-day,
At the Crowning of our King, thus we ever dance and sing.
In the world look out and see: where's so happy a Prince as he?
Where the Nation live so free, and so merry as do we?
Be it peace, or be it war, here at liberty we are,
And enjoy our ease and rest; To the field we are not prest;
Nor are call'd into the Town, to be troubled with the Gown.
Hang all Officers we cry, and the Magistrate too, by;
When the Subsidie's encreast, we are not a penny Sest.
Nor will any go to Law, with the Beggar for a straw.
All which happiness he brags, he doth owe unto his rags._

_Enter_ Snap, Hubert, _and_ Hemskirke.

_Snap._ A Cove comes: Fumbumbis.

_Prig._ To your postures; arm.

_Hub._ Yonder's the Town: I see it.

_Hemsk._ There's our danger
Indeed afore us, if our shadows save not.

_Hig._ Bless your good Worships.

_Fer._ One small piece of mony.

_Prig._ Amongst us all poor wretches.

_Clau._ Blind, and lame.

_Ginks._ For his sake that gives all.

_Hig._ Pitifull Worships.

_Snap._ One little doyt.

_Enter_ Jaculin.

_Jac._ King, by your leave, where are you?

_Fer._ To buy a little bread.

_Hig._ To feed so many
Mouths, as will ever pray for you.

_Prig._ Here be seven of us.

_Hig._ Seven, good Master, O remember seven,
Seven blessings.

_Fer._ Remember, gentle Worship.

_Hig._ 'Gainst seven deadly sins.

_Prig._ And seven sleepers.

_Hig._ If they be hard of heart, and will give nothing--
Alas, we had not a charity this three dayes.

_Hub._ There's amongst you all.

_Fer._ Heaven reward you.

_Prig._ Lord reward you.

_Hig._ The Prince of pity bless thee.

_Hub._ Do I see? or is't my fancy that would have it so?
Ha? 'tis her face: come hither maid.

_Jac._ What ha' you,
Bells for my squirrel? I ha' giv'n bun meat,
You do not love me, do you? catch me a butterfly,
And I'le love you again; when? can you tell?
Peace, we go a birding: I shall have a fine thing.  [_Exit._

_Hub._ Her voyce too sayes the same; but for my head
I would not that her manners were so chang'd.
Hear me thou honest fellow; what's this maiden,
That lives amongst you here?

_Gin._ Ao, ao, ao, ao.

_Hub._ How? nothing but signs?

_Gin._ Ao, ao, ao, ao.

_Hub._ This is strange,
I would fain have it her, but not her thus.

_Hig._ He is de-de-de-de-de-de-deaf, and du-du-dude-dumb Sir.

_Hub._ Slid they did all speak plain ev'n now me thought.
Do'st thou know this same maid?

_Snap._ Why, why, why, why, which, gu, gu, gu, gu, Gods fool
She was bo-bo-bo-bo-born at the barn yonder,
By-be-be-be-be-Beggars Bush-bo-bo-Bush
Her name is, My-my-my-my-my-match: so was her Mo-mo-mo-Mothers too-too.

_Hub._ I understand no word he says; how long
Has she been here?

_Snap._ Lo-lo-long enough to be ni-ni-nigled, and she ha' go-go-go-good
luck.

_Hub._ I must be better inform'd, than by this way.
Here was another face too, that I mark'd
Of the old mans: but they are vanish'd all
Most suddenly: I will come here again,
O, that I were so happy, as to find it,
What I yet hope: it is put on.

_Hem._ What mean you Sir,
To stay there with that stammerer?

_Hub._ Farewell friend,--
It will be worth return, to search: Come,
Protect us our disguise now, pre'thee _Hemskirk_
If we be taken, how do'st thou imagine
This town will use us, that hath stood so long
Out against _Wolfort_?

_Hem._ Ev'n to hang us forth
Upon their walls a sunning, to make Crows meat,
If I were not assur'd o' the _Burgomaster_,
And had a pretty excuse to see a niece there,
I should scarce venture.

_Hub._  Come 'tis now too late
To look back at the ports: good luck, and enter. [_Exeunt._




SCENA II.


    _Enter_ Goswin.

_Gos._ Still blow'st thou there? and from all other parts,
Do all my agents sleep, that nothing comes?
There's a conspiracy of windes, and servants,
If not of Elements, to ha' me break;
What should I think unless the Seas, and Sands
Had swallow'd up my ships? or fire had spoil'd
My ware-houses? or death devour'd my Factors?
I must ha' had some returns.

_Enter_ Merchants.

_1 Mer._ 'Save you Sir.

_Gos._ 'Save you.

_1 Mer._ No news yet o' your Ships?

_Gos._ Not any yet Sir.

_1 Mer._ 'Tis strange.            [_Exit._

_Gos._ 'Tis true Sir: what a voyce was here now?
This was one passing bell, a thousand ravens
Sung in that man now, to presage my ruins.

_2 Mer._ _Goswin_, good day, these winds are very constant.

_Gos._ They are so Sir; to hurt--

_2 Mer._  Ha' you had no letters
Lately from _England_, nor from _Denmark_?

_Gos._ Neither.

_2 Mer._ This wind brings them; nor no news over land,
Through _Spain_, from the _Straights_?

_Gos._ Not any.

_2 Mer._ I am sorry Sir.           [_Exit._

_Gos._ They talk me down: and as 'tis said of Vulturs
They scent a field fought, and do smell the carkasses
By many hundred miles: So do these, my wracks
At greater distances. Why, thy will Heaven
Come on, and be: yet if thou please, preserve me;
But in my own adventure, here at home,
Of my chast love, to keep me worthy of her,
It shall be put in scale 'gainst all ill fortunes:
I am not broken yet: nor should I fall,
Me thinks with less than that, that ruins all.    [_Exit._




SCENA III.


_Enter_ Van-dunck, Hubert, Hemskirk, _and_ Margaret, Boors.

_Van._ Captain, you are welcom; so is this your friend
Most safely welcom, though our Town stand out
Against your Master, you shall find good quarter:
The troth is, we not love him: _Margaret_ some wine,
Let's talk a little treason, if we can
Talk treason, 'gainst the traitors; by your leave, Gentlemen,
We, here in _Bruges_, think he do's usurp,
And therefore I am bold with him.

_Hub._  Sir, your boldness
Happily becomes your mouth, but not our ears,
While we are his servants; And as we come here,
Not to ask questions, walk forth on your walls,
Visit your courts of guard, view your munition,
Ask of your corn-provisions, nor enquire
Into the least, as spies upon your strengths,
So let's entreat, we may receive from you
Nothing in passage or discourse, but what
We may with gladness, and our honesties here,
And that shall seal our welcom.

_Van._  Good: let's drink then,
Fill out, I keep mine old pearl still Captain.

_Marg._  I hang fast man.

_Hen._  Old Jewels commend their keeper, Sir.

_Van._  Here's to you with a heart, my Captains friend,
With a good heart, and if this make us speak
Bold words, anon, 'tis all under the Rose
Forgotten: drown all memory, when we drink.

_Hub._  'Tis freely spoken noble _Burgomaster_,
I'le do you right.

_Hem._  Nay Sir mine heer _Van-dunck_
Is a true Statesman.

_Van._  Fill my Captains cup there, O that your Master _Wolfort_
Had been an honest man.

_Hub._  Sir?

_Van._  Under the Rose.

_Hem._  Here's to you _Marget_.

_Marg._ Welcome, welcome Captain.

_Van._ Well said my pearl still.

_Hem._ And how does my Niece?
Almost a Woman, I think? This friend of mine,
I drew along w[i]th me, through so much hazard,
Only to see her: she was my errand.

_Van._  I, a kind Uncle you are (fill him his glass)
That in seven years, could not find leisure--

_Hem._  No,
It's not so much.

_Van_. I'le bate you ne'r an hour on't,
It was before the _Brabander_ 'gan his War,
For moon-shine, i'the water there, his Daughter
That never was lost: yet you could not find time
To see a Kinswoman; but she is worth the seeing, Sir,
Now you are come, you ask if she were a Woman?
She is a Woman, Sir, fetch her forth _Marget_.    [_Exit_ Marg.
And a fine Woman, and has Suitors.

_Hem_. How?
What Suitors are they?

_Van_. Bachellors; young Burgers:
And one, a Gallant, the young Prince of Merchants
We call him here in _Bruges_.

_Hem_. How? a Merchant?
I thought, _Vandunke_, you had understood me better,
And my Niece too, so trusted to you by me,
Than t'admit of such in name of Suitors.

_Van_. Such? he is such a such, as were she mine
I'd give him thirty thousand crowns with her.

_Hem_. But the same things, Sir, fit not you and me.     [_Ex_.

_Van_. Why, give's some wine, then; this will fit us all:
Here's to you still, my Captains friend: All out:
And still, would _Wolfort_ were an honest man,
Under the Rose, I speak it: but this Merchant
Is a brave boy: he lives so, i'the Town here,
We know not what to think on him: at some times
We fear he will be Bankrupt; he do's stretch
Tenter his credit so; embraces all,
And to't, the winds have been contrary long.
But then, if he should have all his returns,
We think he would be a King, and are half sure on't.
Your Master is a Traitor, for all this,
Under the Rose: Here's to you; and usurps
The Earldom from a better man.

_Hub_. I marry, Sir,
Where is that man?

_Van_. Nay soft: and I could tell you
'Tis ten to one I would not: here's my hand,
I love not _Wolfort_: sit you still, with that:
Here comes my Captain again, and his fine Niece,
And there's my Merchant; view him well: fill wine here.

_Enter_ Hemskirk, Gertrude, _and_ Goswin.

_Hem_. You must not only know me for your Uncle
Now, but obey me: you, go cast your self
Away, upon a Dunghil here? a Merchant?
A petty fellow? one that makes his Trade
With Oaths and perjuries?

_Gos_. What is that you say, Sir?
If it be me you speak of, as your eye
Seems to direct, I wish you would speak to me, Sir.

_Hem_. Sir, I do say, she is no Merchandize,
Will that suffice you?

_Gos_. Merchandize good Sir?
Though ye be Kinsman to her, take no leave thence
To use me with contempt: I ever thought
Your Niece above all price.

_Hem_. And do so still, Sir,
I assure you, her rates are more than you are worth.

_Gos_. You do not know, what a Gentleman's worth, Sir,
Nor can you value him.

_H[u]b_. Well said Merchant.

_Van_. Nay,
Let him alone, and ply your matter.

_Hem_. A Gentleman?
What o'the Wool-pack? or the Sugar-chest?
Or lists of Velvet? which is't pound, or yard,
You vent your Gentry by?

_Hub_. O _Hemskirk_, fye.

_Van_. Come, do not mind 'em, drink, he is no _Wolfort_,
Captain, I advise you.

_Hem_. Alas, my pretty man,
I think't be angry, by its look: Come hither,
Turn this way, a little: if it were the blood
Of _Charlemaine_, as't may (for ought I know)
Be some good Botchers issue, here in _Bruges_.

_Gos_. How?

_Hem_. Nay: I'me not certain of that; of this I am,
If it once buy, and sell, its Gentry is gone.

_Gos_. Ha, ha.

_Hem._ You are angry, though ye laugh.

_Gos._ No, now 'tis pity
Of your poor argument. Do not you, the Lords
Of Land (if you be any) sell the grass,
The Corn, the Straw, the Milk, the Cheese?

_Van._ And Butter:
Remember Butter; do not leave out Butter.

_Gos._ The Beefs and Muttons that your grounds are stor'd with?
Swine, with the very mast, beside the Woods?

_Hem._ No, for those sordid uses we have Tenants,
Or else our Bailiffs.

_Gos._ Have not we, Sir, Chap-men,
And Factors, then to answer these? your honour
Fetch'd from the Heralds _ABC_, and said over
With your Court faces, once an hour, shall never
Make me mistake my self. Do not your Lawyers
Sell all their practice, as your Priests their prayers?
What is not bought, and sold? The company
That you had last, what had you for't, i'faith?

_Hem._ You now grow sawcy.

_Gos._ Sure I have been bred
Still, with my honest liberty, and must use it.

_Hem._ Upon your equals then.

_Gos._ Sir, he that will
Provoke me first, doth make himself my equal.

_Hem._ Do ye hear? no more.

_Gos._ Yes, Sir, this little, I pray you,
And't shall be aside, then after, as you please.
You appear the Uncle, Sir, to her I love
More than mine eyes; and I have heard your scorns
With so much scoffing, and so much shame,
As each strive which is greater: But, believe me,
I suck'd not in this patience with my milk.
Do not presume, because you see me young,
Or cast despights on my profession
For the civility and tameness of it.
A good man bears a contumely worse
Than he would do an injury. Proceed not
To my offence: wrong is not still successful,
Indeed it is not: I would approach your Kins-woman
With all respect, done to your self and her.

_Hem._ Away Companion: handling her? take that.        [_Strikes him._

_Gos._ Nay, I do love no blows, Sir, there's exchange.

_Hub._  Hold, Sir.  (_He gets_ Hemskirks _sword and cuts him on the head._

_Mar._  O murther.

_Ger._  Help my _Goswin_.

_Mar._ Man.

_Van._ Let 'em alone; my life for one.

_Gos._ Nay come,
If you have will.

_Hub._ None to offend you, I, Sir.

_Gos._ He that had, thank himself: not hand her? yes Sir,
And clasp her, and embrace her; and (would she
Now go with me) bear her through all her Race,
Her Father, Brethren, and her Uncles, arm'd,
And all their Nephews, though they stood a wood
Of Pikes, and wall of Canon: kiss me _Gertrude_,
Quake not, but kiss me.

_Van._ Kiss him, Girl, I bid you;
My Merchant Royal; fear no Uncles: hang 'em,
Hang up all Uncles: Are not we in _Bruges_?
Under the Rose here?

_Gos._ In this circle, Love,
Thou art as safe, as in a Tower of Brass;
Let such as do wrong, fear.

_Van._ I, that's good,
Let _Wolfort_ look to that.

_Gos._ Sir, here she stands,
Your Niece, and my beloved. One of these titles
She must apply to; if unto the last,
Not all the anger can be sent unto her,
In frown, or voyce, or other art, shall force her,
Had _Hercules_ a hand in't: Come, my Joy,
Say thou art mine, aloud Love, and profess it.

_Van._ Doe: and I drink to it.

_Gos._ Prethee say so, Love.

_Ger._ 'Twould take away the honour from my blushes:
Do not you play the tyrant, sweet: they speak it.

_Hem._ I thank you niece.

_Gos._ Sir, thank her for your life,
And fetch your sword within.

_Hem._ You insult too much
With your good fortune, Sir.     [_Exeunt_ Gos. _and_ Ger.

_Hub._ A brave clear Spirit;
_Hemskirk_, you were to blame: a civil habit
Oft covers a good man: and you may meet
In person of a Merchant, with a soul
As resolute, and free, and all wayes worthy,
As else in any file of man-kind: pray you,
What meant you so to slight him?

_Hem._ 'Tis done now,
Ask no more of it; I must suffer.     [_Exit_ Hemskirk.

_Hub._ This
Is still the punishment of rashness, sorrow.
Well; I must to the woods, for nothing here
Will be got out. There, I may chance to learn
Somewhat to help my enquiries further.

_Van._ Ha?
A Looking-glass?

_Hub._ How now, brave _Burgomaster_?

_Van._ I love no _Wolforts_, and my name's _Vandunk_,

_Hub._ _Van drunk_ it's rather: come, go sleep within.

_Van._ Earl _Florez_ is right heir, and this same _Wolfort_
Under the Rose I speak it--

_Hub._ Very hardly.

_Van-d._ Usurps: and a rank Traitor, as ever breath'd,
And all that do uphold him. Let me goe,
No man shall hold me, that upholds him;
Do you uphold him?

_Hub._ No.

_Van._ Then hold me up.          [_Exeunt._

_Enter_ Goswin, _and_ Hemskirk.

_Hem._ Sir, I presume, you have a sword of your own,
That can so handle anothers.

_Gos._ Faith you may Sir.

_Hem._ And ye have made me have so much better thoughts of you
As I am bound to call you forth.

_Gos._ For what Sir?

_Hem._ To the repairing of mine honour, and hurt here.

_Gos._ Express your way.

_Hem._ By fight, and speedily.

_Gos._ You have your will: Require you any more?

_Hem._ That you be secret: and come single.

_Gos._ I will.

_Hem._ As you are the Gentleman you would be thought.

_Gos._ Without the Conjuration: and I'le bring
Only my sword, which I will fit to yours,
I'le take his length within.

_Hem._ Your place now Sir?

_Gos._ By the Sand-hills.

_Hem._ Sir, nearer to the woods,
If you thought so, were fitter.

_Gos._ There, then.

_Hem._ Good.
Your time?

_Gos._ 'Twixt seven and eight.

_Hem._ You'l give me Sir
Cause to report you worthy of my Niece,
If you come, like your promise.

_Gos._ If I do not,
Let no man think to call me unworthy first,
I'le do't my self, and justly wish to want her.--     [_Exeunt._




_ACTUS TERTIUS. SCENA PRIMA._


_Enter three or four_ Boors.

_1 B._ Come, _English_ beer Hostess, _English_ beer by th' belly.

_2 B._ Stark beer boy, stout and strong beer: so, sit down Lads,
And drink me upsey-Dutch:
Frolick, and fear not.

_Enter_ Higgen _like a Sow-gelder, singing._

Hig. _Have ye any work for the Sow-gelder, hoa,
My horn goes too high too low, too high too low.
Have ye any Piggs, Calves, or Colts,
Have ye any Lambs in your holts
To cut for the Stone,
Here comes a cunning one.
Have ye any braches to spade,
Or e're a fair maid
That would be a Nun,
Come kiss me, 'tis done.
Hark how my merry horn doth blow,
Too high too low, too high too low._

_1 B._ O excellent! two-pence a piece boyes, two-pence a piece.
Give the boys some drink there. Piper, wet your whistle,
Canst tell me a way now, how to cut off my wifes Concupiscence?

_Hig._ I'le sing ye a Song for't.

      _The_ SONG.

_Take her, and hug her,
And turn her and tug her,
And turn her again boy, again,
Then if she mumble,
Or if her tail tumble,
Kiss her amain hoy, amain.
Do thy endeavour,
To take off her feaver,
Then her disease no longer will raign.
If nothing will serve her,
Then thus to preserve her,
Swinge her amain boy amain.
Give her cold jelly
To take up her belly,
And once a day swinge her again,
If she stand all these pains,
Then knock out her brains,
Her disease no longer will reign._

_1 Bo._ More excellent, more excellent, sweet Sow-gelder.

_2 Bo._ Three-pence a piece, three-pence a piece.

_Hig._ Will you hear a Song how the Devil was gelded?

_3 Bo._ I, I, let's hear the Devil roar, Sow-gelder.


            SONG.

             1.
_He ran at me first in the shape of a Ram,
And over and over the Sow-Gelder came;
I rise and I halter'd him fast by the horn,
I pluckt out his Stones as you'd pick out a Corn.
Baa, quoth the Devil, and forth he slunk,
And left us a Carcase of Mutton that stunk.

             2.
The next time I rode a good mile and a half,
Where I heard he did live in disguise of a Calf,
I bound and I gelt him, ere he did any evil;
He was here at his best, but a sucking Devil.
Maa, yet he cry'd, and forth he did steal,
And this was sold after, for excellent Veal.

             3.
Some half a year after in the form of a Pig,
I met with the Rogue, and he look'd very big;
I catch'd at his leg, laid him down on a log,
Ere a man could fart twice, I had made him a Hog.
Owgh, quoth the Devil, and forth gave a Jerk,
That a Jew was converted, and eat of the Perk._

_1 Bo._ Groats apiece, Groats apiece, Groats apiece,
There sweet Sow-Gelder.

_Enter_ Prig _and_ Ferret.

_Prig._ Will ye see any feats of activity,
Some Sleight of hand, Legerdemain? hey pass,
Presto, be gone there?

_2 Bo._ Sit down Jugler.

_Prig._ Sirrah, play you your art well; draw near Piper:
Look you, my honest friends, you see my hands;
Plain dealing is no Devil: lend me some Money,
Twelve-pence a piece will serve.

_1. 2. B._ There, there.

_Prig._ I thank you,
Thank ye heartily: when shall I pay ye?

_All B._ Ha, ha, ha, by th' Mass this was a fine trick.

_Prig._ A merry sleight toy: but now I'll show your Worships
A trick indeed.

_Hig._ Mark him well now my Masters.

_Prig._ Here are three balls,
These balls shall be three bullets,
One, two, and three: _ascentibus, malentibus_.

_Presto_, be gone: they are vanish'd: fair play, Gentlemen.
Now these three, like three Bullets, from your three Noses
Will I pluck presently: fear not, no harm Boys,

_Titere, tu patule._

_1 B._ Oh, oh, oh.

_Prig._ _Recubans sub jermlne fagi._

_2 B._ Ye pull too hard; ye pull too hard.

_Prig._ Stand fair then:
_Silvertramtrim-tram._

_3 B._ Hold, hold, hold.

_Prig._ Come aloft, bullets three, with a whim-wham.
Have ye their Moneys?

_Hig._ Yes, yes.

_1 B._ Oh rare Jugler!

_2 B._ Oh admirable Jugler!

_Prig._ One trick more yet;
Hey, come aloft; _sa, sa, flim, flum, taradumbis_?
East, West, North, South, now fly like _Jack_ with a _bumbis_.
Now all your money's gone; pray search your pockets.

_1 B._ Humh.

_2 B._ He.

_3 B._ The Devil a penny's here!

_Prig._ This was a rare trick.

_1 B._ But 'twould be a far rarer to restore it.

_Prig._ I'll do ye that too; look upon me earnestly,
And move not any ways your eyes from this place,
This Button here? pow, whir, whiss, shake your pockets.

_1 B._ By th' Mass 'tis here again, boys.

_Prig._ Rest ye merry;
My first trick has paid me.

_All B._ I, take it, take it,
And take some drink too.

_Prig._ Not a drop now I thank you;
Away, we are discover'd else.     [_Exit._

_Enter_ Gerrard _like a blind_ Aqua vitae man, _and a Boy, singing the
Song._

_Bring out your Cony-skins, fair maids to me,
And hold 'em fair that I may see;
Grey, black, and blue: for your smaller skins,
I'll give ye looking-glasses, pins:
And for your whole Coney, here's ready, ready Money.
Come Gentle_ Jone, _do thou begin
With thy black, black, black Coney-skin.
And_ Mary _then, and_ Jane _will follow,
With their silver hair'd skins, and their yellow.
The white Cony-skin, I will not lay by,
For though it be faint, 'tis fair to the eye;
The grey, it is warm, but yet for my Money,
Give me the bonny, bonny black Cony.
Come away fair Maids, your skins will decay:
Come, and take money, maids, put your ware away.
Cony-skins, Cony-skins, have ye any Cony-skins,
I have fine bracelets, and fine silver pins._

_Ger._ Buy any Brand Wine, buy any Brand Wine?

_Boy._ Have ye any Cony-skins?

_2 [B.]_ My fine Canary-bird, there's a Cake for thy Worship.

_1 B._ Come fill, fill, fill, fill suddenly: let's see Sir,
What's this?

_Ger._ A penny, Sir.

_1 B._ Fill till't be six-pence,
And there's my Pig.

_Boy._ This is a Counter, Sir.

_1 B._ A Counter! stay ye, what are these then?
O execrable Jugler! O dama'd Jugler!
Look in your hose, hoa, this comes of looking forward.

_3 B._ Devil a Dunkirk! what a Rogue's this Jugler!
This hey pass, repass, h'as repast us sweetly.

_2 B._ Do ye call these tricks.

_Enter_ Higgen.

_Hig._ Have ye any Ends of Gold, or Silver?

_2 B._ This Fellow comes to mock us; Gold or Silver? cry Copper.

_1 B._ Yes, my good Friend,
We have e'n an end of all we have.

_Hig._ 'Tis well Sir,
You have the less to care for: Gold and Silver.     [_Exit._

_Enter_ Prigg.

_Pr._ Have ye any old Cloaks to sell, have ye any old Cloaks to sell?
[_Exit._

_1 B._ Cloaks! Look about ye Boys: mine's gone!

_2 B._ A ------ juggle 'em?
------ O they're Prestoes: mine's gone too!

_3 B._ Here's mine yet.

_1 B._ Come, come let's drink then more Brand Wine.

_Boy._ Here Sir.

_1 B._ If e'r I catch your Sow-gelder, by this hand I'll strip him:
Were ever Fools so ferkt? We have two Cloaks yet;
And all our Caps; the Devil take the Flincher.

_All B._ Yaw, yaw, yaw, yaw.

_Enter_ Hemskirk.

_Hem._ Good do'n my honest Fellows,
You are merry here I see.

_3 B._ 'Tis all we have left, Sir.

_Hem._ What hast thou? Aqua vitae?

_Boy._ Yes.

_Hem._ Fill out then;
And give these honest Fellows round.

_All B._ We thank ye.

_Hem._ May I speak a word in private to ye?

_All B._ Yes Sir.

_Hem._ I have a business for you, honest Friends,
If you dare lend your help, shall get you crowns.

_Ger._ Ha!
Lead me a little nearer, Boy.

_1 B._ What is't Sir?
If it be any thing to purchase money,
Which is our want, [command] us.

_Boors._ All, all, all, Sir.

_Hem._ You know the young spruce Merchant in _Bruges_?

_2 B._ Who? Master _Goswin_?

_Hem._ That he owes me money,
And here in town there is no stirring of him.

_Ger._ Say ye so?

_Hem._ This day, upon a sure appointment,
He meets me a mile hence, by the Chase side,
Under the row of Oaks; do you know it?

_All B._ Yes Sir.

_Hem._ Give 'em more drink: there if you dare but venture
When I shall give the word to seize upon him
Here's twenty pound.

_3 B._ Beware the Jugler.

_Hem._ If he resist, down with him, have no mercy.

_1 B._ I warrant you, we'll hamper him.

_Hem._ To discharge you,
I have a Warrant here about me.

_3 B._ Here's our Warrant,
This carries fire i'th' Tail.

_Hem._ Away with me then,
The time draws on,
I must remove so insolent a Suitor,
And if he be so rich, make him pay ransome
Ere he see _Bruges_ Towers again. Thus wise men
Repair the hurts they take by a disgrace,
And piece the Lions skin with the Foxes case.

_Ger._ I am glad I have heard this sport yet.

_Hem._ There's for thy drink, come pay the house within Boys,
And lose no time.

_Ger._ Away with all our haste too.      [_Exeunt._




SCENE II.


_Enter_ Goswin.

_Gos._ No wind blow fair yet? no return of moneys?
Letters? nor any thing to hold my hopes up?
Why then 'tis destin'd, that I fall, fall miserably!
My credit I was built on, sinking with me.
Thou boystrous North-wind, blowing my misfortunes,
And frosting all my hopes to cakes of coldness;
Yet stay thy fury; give the gentle South
Yet leave to court those sails that bring me safety,
And you auspicious fires, bright twins in heaven
Daunce on the shrowds; he blows still stubbornly,
And on his boystrous Rack rides my sad ruin;
There is no help, there can be now no comfort,
To morrow with the Sun-set, sets my credit.
Oh misery! thou curse of man, thou plague,
In the midst of all our strength thou strik'st us;
My vertuous Love is lost too: all, what I have been,
No more hereafter to be seen than shadow;
To prison now? well, yet there's this hope left me;
I may sink fairly under this days venture,
And so to morrow's cross'd, and all those curses:
Yet manly I'll invite my Fate, base fortune
Shall never say, she has cut my throat in fear.
This is the place his challenge call'd me to,
And was a happy one at this time for me,
For let me fall before my Foe i'th' field,
And not at Bar, before my Creditors;
H'as kept his word: now Sir, your swords tongue only
Loud as you dare, all other language--

_Enter_ Hemskirke.

_Hem._ Well Sir,
You shall not be long troubled: draw.

_Gos._ 'Tis done Sir,
And now have at ye.

_Hem._ Now.

_Enter_ Boors.

_Gos._ Betray'd to Villains!
Slaves ye shall buy me bravely,
And thou base coward.

_Enter_ Gerrard _and_ Beggars.

_Ger._ Now upon 'em bravely,
Conjure 'em soundly Boys.

_Boors._ Hold, hold.

_Ger._ Lay on still,
Down with that Gentleman rogue, swinge him to sirrup.
Retire Sir, and take Breath: follow, and take him,
Take all, 'tis lawful prize.

_Boors._ We yield.

_Ger._ Down with 'em
Into the Wood, and rifle 'em, tew 'em, swinge 'em,
Knock me their brains into their Breeches.     [_Exeunt._

_Boors._ Hold, hold.

_Gos._ What these men are I know not, nor for what cause
They shou'd thus thrust themselves into my danger,
Can I imagine. But sure Heavens hand was in't!
Nor why this coward Knave should deal so basely
To eat me up with Slaves: but Heaven I thank thee,
I hope thou hast reserv'd me to an end
Fit for thy creature, and worthy of thine honour:
Would all my other dangers here had suffered,
With what a joyful heart should I go home then?
Where now, Heaven knows, like him that waits his sentence,
Or hears his passing Bell; but there's my hope still.

_Enter_ Gerrard.

_Ger._ Blessing upon you Master.

_Gos._ Thank ye; leave me,
For by my troth I have nothing now to give thee.

_Ger._ Indeed I do not ask Sir, only it grieves me
To see ye look so sad; now goodness keep ye
From troubles in your mind.

_Gos._ If I were troubled,
What could thy comfort do? prithee _Clause_, leave me.

_Ger._ Good Master be not angry; for what I say
Is out of true love to ye.

_Gos._ I know thou lov'st me.

_Ger._ Good Mr. blame that love then, if I prove so sawcy
To ask ye why ye are sad.

_Gos._ Most true, I am so,
And such a sadness I have got will sink me.

_Ger._ Heaven shield it, Sir.

_Gos._ Faith, thou must lose thy Master.

_Ger._ I had rather lose my neck, Sir: would I knew--

_Gos._ What would the knowledg do thee good so miserable,
Thou canst not help thy self? when all my ways
Nor all the friends I have--

_Ger._ You do not know Sir,
What I can do: cures sometimes, for mens cares
Flow, where they least expect 'em.

_Gos._ I know thou wouldst do,
But farewell _Clause_, and pray for thy poor Master.

_Ger._ I will not leave ye.

_Gos._ How?

_Ger._ I dare not leave ye, Sir, I must not leave ye,
And till ye beat me dead, I will not leave ye.
By what ye hold most precious, by Heavens goodness,
As your fair youth may prosper, good Sir tell me:
My mind believes yet something's in my power
May ease you of this trouble.

_Gos._ I will tell thee,
For a hundred thousand crowns upon my credit,
Taken up of Merchants to supply my traffiques,
The winds and weather envying of my fortune,
And no return to help me off, yet shewing
To morrow, _Clause_, to morrow, which must come,
In prison thou shalt find me poor and broken.

_Ger._ I cannot blame your grief Sir.

_Gos._ Now, what say'st thou?

_Ger._ I say you should not shrink, for he that gave ye,
Can give you more; his power can bring ye off Sir,
When friends and all forsake ye, yet he sees you.

_Gos._ There's all my hope.

_Ger._ Hope still Sir, are you ty'd
Within the compass of a day, good Master,
To pay this mass of mony?

_Gos._ Ev'n to morrow:
But why do I stand mocking of my misery?
Is't not enough the floods, and friends forget me?

_Ger._ Will no less serve?

_Gos._ What if it would?

_Ger._ Your patience,
I do not ask to mock ye: 'tis a great sum,
A sum for mighty men to start and stick at;
But not for honest: have ye no friends left ye,
None that have felt your bounty? worth this duty?

_Gos._ Duty? thou knowst it not.

_Ger._ It is a duty,
And as a duty, from those men have felt ye,
Should be return'd again: I have gain'd by ye,
A daily alms these seven years you have showr'd on me,
Will half supply your want.

_Gos._ Why do'st thou fool me?
Can'st thou work miracles?

_Ger._ To save my Master,
I can work this.

_Gos._ Thou wilt make me angry with thee.

_Ger._ For doing good?

_Gos._ What power hast thou?

_Ger._ Enquire not:
So I can do it, to preserve my Master;
Nay if it be three parts.

_Gos._ O that I had it,
But good _Clause_, talk no more, I feel thy charity,
As thou hast felt mine: but alas!

_Ger._ Distrust not,
'Tis that that quenches ye: pull up your Spirit,
Your good, your honest, and your noble Spirit;
For if the fortunes of ten thousand people
Can save ye, rest assur'd; you have forgot Sir,
The good ye did, which was the power you gave me;
Ye shall now know the King of Beggars treasure:
And let the winds blow as they list, the Seas roar,
Yet, here to morrow, you shall find your harbour.
Here fail me not, for if I live I'le fit ye.

_Gos._ How fain I would believe thee!

_Ger._ If I ly Master,
Believe no man hereafter.

_Gos._ I will try thee,
But he knows, that knows all.

_Ger._ Know me to morrow,
And if I know not how to cure ye, kill me;
So pass in peace, my best, my worthiest Master.     [_Exeunt._




SCENA III.


_Enter_ Hubert, _like a Huntsman._

_Hub._ Thus have I stoln away disguiz'd from _Hemskirk_
To try these people, for my heart yet tells me
Some of these Beggars, are the men I look for:
Appearing like my self, they have no reason
(Though my intent is fair, my main end honest)
But to avoid me narrowly, that face too,
That womans face, how near it is! O may it
But prove the same, and fortune how I'le bless thee!
Thus, sure they cannot know me, or suspect me,
If to my habit I but change my nature;
As I must do; this is the wood they live in,
A place fit for concealment: where, till fortune
Crown me with that I seek, I'le live amongst 'em.  [_Exit._

_Enter_ Higgen, Prigg, Ferret, Ginks, _and
the rest of the_ Boors.

_Hig._ Come bring 'em out, for here we sit in justice:
Give to each one a cudgel, a good cudgel:
And now attend your sentence. That you are rogues,
And mischievous base rascalls, (there's the point now)
I take it, is confess'd.

_Prig._ Deny it if you dare knaves.

_Boors._ We are Rogues Sir.

_Hig._ To amplify the matter then, rogues as ye are,
And lamb'd ye shall be e're we leave ye.

_Boors._ Yes Sir.

_Hig._ And to the open handling of our justice,
Why did ye this upon the proper person
Of our good Master? were you drunk when you did it?

_Boors._ Yes indeed were we.

_Prig._ You shall be beaten sober.

_Hig._ Was it for want you undertook it?

_Boors._ Yes Sir.

_Hig._ You shall be swing'd abundantly.

_Prig._ And yet for all that,
You shall be poor rogues still.

_Hig._ Has not the Gentleman,
Pray mark this point Brother _Prig_, that noble Gentleman
Reliev'd ye often, found ye means to live by,
By imploying some at Sea, some here, some there;
According to your callings?

_Boors._ 'Tis most true Sir.

_Hig._ Is not the man, an honest man?

_Boors._ Yes truly.

_Hig._ A liberal Gentleman? and as ye are true rascals
Tell me but this, have ye not been drunk, and often,
At his charge?

_Boors._ Often, often.

_Hig._ There's the point then,
They have cast themselves, Brother _Prig_.

_Prig._ A shrewd point, Brother.

_Hig._ Brother, proceed you now; the cause is open,
I am some what weary.

_Prig._ Can you do these things?
You most abhominable stinking Rascals,
You turnip-eating Rogues.

_Boors._ We are truly sorry.

_Prig._ Knock at your hard hearts Rogues, and presently
Give us a sign you feel compunction,
Every man up with's cudgel, and on his neighbour
Bestow such alms, 'till we shall say sufficient,
For there your sentence lyes without partiality;
Either of head, or hide Rogues, without sparing,
Or we shall take the pains to beat you dead else:
You shall know your doom.

_Hig._ One, two, and three about it.

_Prig._ That fellow in the blue, has true Compunction,
[_Beat one another._
He beats his fellows bravely, oh, well struck boyes.

_Enter_ Gerrard.

_Hig._ Up with that blue breech, now playes he the Devil.
So get ye home, drink small beer, and be honest;
Call in the Gentleman.

_Ger._ Do, bring him presently,
His cause I'le hear my self.

_Enter_ Hemskirk.

_Hig. Prig._ With all due reverence,
We do resign Sir.

_Ger._ Now huffing Sir, what's your name?

_Hem._ What's that to you Sir?

_Ger._ It shall be ere we part.

_Hem._ My name is _Hemskirk_,
I follow the Earl, which you shall feel.

_Ger._ No threatning,
For we shall cool you Sir; why did'st thou basely
Attempt the murder of the Merchant _Goswin_?

_Hem._ What power hast thou to ask me?

_Ger._ I will know it,
Or fley thee till thy pain discover it.

_Hem._ He did me wrong, base wrong.

_Ger._ That cannot save ye,
Who sent ye hither? and what further villanies
Have you in hand?

_Hem._ Why would'st thou know? what profit,
If I had any private way, could rise
Out of my knowledge, to do thee commodity?
Be sorry for what thou hast done, and make amends fool,
I'le talk no further to thee, nor these Rascals.

_Ger._ Tye him to that tree.

_Hem._ I have told you whom I follow.

_Ger._ The Devil you should do, by your villanies,
Now he that has the best way, wring it from him.

_Hig._ I undertake it: turn him to the Sun boyes;
Give me a fine sharp rush, will ye confess yet?

_Hem._ Ye have rob'd me already, now you'le murder me.

_Hig._ Murder your nose a little: does your head purge Sir?
To it again, 'twill do ye good.

_Hem._ Oh,
I cannot tell you any thing.

_Ger._ Proceed then.

_Hig._ There's maggots in your nose, I'le fetch 'em out Sir.

_Hem._ O my head breaks.

_Hig._ The best thing for the rheum Sir,
That falls into your worships eyes.

_Hem._  Hold, hold.

_Ger._ Speak then.

_Hem._ I know not what.

_Hig._ It lyes in's brain yet,
In lumps it lyes, I'le fetch it out the finest;
What pretty faces the fool makes? heigh!

_Hem._ Hold,
Hold, and I'le tell ye all, look in my doublet;
And there within the lining in a paper,
You shall find all.

_Ger._ Go fetch that paper hither,
And let him loose for this time.

_Enter_ Hubert.

_Hub._ Good ev'n my honest friends.

_Ger._ Good ev'n good fellow.

_Hub._ May a poor huntsman, with a merry heart,
A voice shall make the forest ring about him,
Get leave to live amongst ye? true as steel, boyes?
That knows all chases, and can watch all hours,
And with my quarter staff, though the Devil bid stand,
Deal such an alms, shall make him roar again?
Prick ye the fearfull hare through cross waves, sheep-walks,
And force the crafty Reynard climb the quicksetts;
Rouse ye the lofty Stag, and with my bell-horn,
Ring him a knel, that all the woods shall mourn him,
'Till in his funeral tears, he fall before me?
The _Polcat_, _Marterne_, and the rich skin'd _Lucerne_
I know to chase, the Roe, the wind out-stripping
_Isgrin_ himself, in all his bloody anger
I can beat from the bay, and the wild Sounder
Single, and with my arm'd staff, turn the Boar,
Spight of his foamy tushes, and thus strike him;
'Till he fall down my feast.

_Ger._ A goodly fellow.

_Hub._ What mak'st thee here, ha?     [_aside._

_Ger._ We accept thy fellowship.

_Hub._ _Hemskirk_, thou art not right I fear, I fear thee.     [_aside._

_Enter_ Ferret, _with a Letter._

_Fer._ Here is the paper: and as he said we found it.

_Ger._ Give me it, I shall make a shift yet, old as I am,
To find your knavery: you are sent here, Sirra,
To discover certain Gentlemen, a spy-knave,
And if ye find 'em, if not by perswasion
To bring 'em back, by poyson to despatch 'em.

_Hub._ By poyson, ha?

_Ger._  Here is another, _Hubert_;
What is that _Hubert_ Sir?

_Hem._ You may perceive there.

_Ger._ I may perceive a villany and a rank one,
Was he joyn'd partner of thy knavery?

_Hem._ No.
He had an honest end, would I had had so,
Which makes him scape such cut-throats.

_Ger._ So it seems.
For here thou art commanded, when that _Hubert_
Has done his best and worthiest service, this way
To cut his throat, for here he's set down dangerous.

_Hub._ This is most impious.

_Ger._ I am glad we have found ye,
Is not this true?

_Hem._ Yes; what are you the better?

_Ger._ You shall perceive Sir, ere you get your freedom:
Take him aside, and friend, we take thee to us,
Into our company, thou dar'st be true unto us?

_Hig._ I, and obedient too?

_Hub._  As you had bred me.

_Ger._ Then take our hand: thou art now a servant to us,
Welcom him all.

_Hig._ Stand off, stand off: I'le do it,
We bid ye welcom three wayes; first for your person,
Which is a promising person, next for your quality,
Which is a decent, and a gentle quality,
Last for the frequent means you have to feed us,
You can steal 'tis to be presum'd.

_Hub._ Yes, venison, and if you want--

_Hig._ 'Tis well you understand right,
And shall practise daily: you can drink too?

_Hub._ Soundly.

_Hig._ And ye dare know a woman from a weathercock?

_Hub._ If I handle her.

_Ger._ Now swear him.

_Hig._ I crown thy _nab_, with a _gag of benbouse_,
And _stall_ thee by the _Salmon_ into the _clows_,
To _mand_ on the _pad_, and _strike_ all the _cheats_;
To _Mill_ from the _Ruffmans_, _commision_ and _slates_,
_Twang dell_'s, i' the _stiromell_, and let the _Quire Cuffin_:
And _Herman Beck strine_, and _trine_ to the _Ruffin_.

_Ger._ Now interpret this unto him.

_Hig._ I pour on thy pate a pot of good ale,
And by the Rogues [oth] a Rogue thee instal:
To beg on the way, to rob all thou meets;
To steal from the hedge, both the shirt and the sheets:
And lye with thy wench in the straw till she twang,
Let the Constable, Justice, and Devil go hang.

_Hig._ You are welcom Brother.

_All._ Welcom, welcom, welcom, but who shall have the keeping
Of this fellow?

_Hub._  Sir, if you dare but trust me;
For if I have kept wild dogs and beasts for wonder,
And made 'em tame too: give into my custody
This roaring Rascal, I shall hamper him,
With all his knacks and knaveries, and I fear me
Discover yet a further villany in him;
O he smells ranck o'th' Rascal.

_Ger._ Take him to thee,
But if he scape--

_Hub._ Let me be ev'n hang'd for him,
Come Sir, I'le tye ye to my leash.

_Hem._ Away Rascal.

_Hub._ Be not so stubborn: I shall swindge ye soundly,
And ye play tricks with me.

_Ger._ So, now come in,
But ever have an eye Sir, to your Prisoner.

_Hub._  He must blind both mine eyes, if he get from me.

_Ger._ Go get some victuals, and some drink, some good drink;
For this day we'll keep holy to good fortune,
Come, and be frolick with us.

_Hig._ You are a stranger, Brother, I pray lead,
You must, you must, Brother.         [_Exeunt._




SCENE IV.


_Enter_ Goswin _and_ Gertrude.

_Ger._ Indeed you're welcome: I have heard your scape,
And therefore give her leave, that only loves you;
(Truly and dearly loves you) give her joy leave
To bid you welcome: what is't makes you sad man?
Why do you look so wild? Is't I offend you?
Beshrew my heart, not willingly.

_Gos._ No, _Gertrude_.

_Ger._ Is't the delay of that ye long have look'd for,
A happy marriage? now I come to urge it.
Now when you please to finish it?

_Gos._ No news yet?

_Ger._ Do you hear Sir?

_Gos._ Yes.

_Ger._ Do you love me?

_Gos._ Have I liv'd
In all the happiness Fortune could seat me,
In all mens fair opinions?

_Ger._ I have provided
A Priest, that's ready for us.

_Gos._ And can the Devil,
In one ten days, that Devil Chance devour me?

_Ger._ We'll fly to what place you please.

_Gos._ No Star prosperous!
All at a swoop?

_Ger._ You do not love me _Goswin_?
You will not look upon me?

_Gos._ Can mens Prayers
Shot up to Heaven, with such a zeal as mine are,
Fall back like lazy mists, and never prosper?
Jives I must wear, and cold must be my comfort;
Darkness, and want of meat; alas she weeps too,
Which is the top of all my sorrows, _Gertrude_.

_Ger._ No, no, you will not know me; my poor beauty,
Which has been worth your eyes.

_Gos._ The time grows on still;
And like a tumbling wave, I see my ruine
Come rowling over me.

_Ger._ Yet will ye know me?

_Gos._ For a hundred thousand Crowns.

_Ger._ Yet will ye love me?
Tell me but how I have deserv'd your slighting?

_Gos._ For a hundred thousand Crowns?

_Ger._ Farewel Dissembler.

_Gos._ Of which I have scarce ten: O how it starts me!

_Ger._ And may the next you love, hearing my ruine.

_Gos._ I had forgot my self, O my best _Gertrude_,
Crown of my joys and comforts.

_Ger._ Sweet what ails ye?
I thought you had been vext with me.

_Gos._ My mind, Wench,
My mind o'rflow'd with sorrow, sunk my memory.

_Ger._ Am I not worthy of the knowledge of it?
And cannot I as well affect your sorrows,
As your delights? you love no other Woman?

_Gos._ No, I protest.

_Ger._ You have no ships lost lately?

_Gos._ None, that I know of.

_Ger._ I hope you have spilt no blood, whose innocence
May lay this on your conscience.

_Gos._ Clear, by Heaven.

_Ger._ Why should you be thus then?

_Gos._ Good _Gertrude_ ask not,
Ev'n by the love you bear me.

_Ger._ I am obedient.

_Gos._ Go in, my fair, I will not be long from ye,
Nor long I fear me with thee. At my return
Dispose me as you please.

_Ger._ The good gods guide ye.
[_Exit._

_Gos._ Now for my self, which is the least I hope for,
And when that fails, for mans worst fortune, pity.     [_Exit._




_ACTUS QUARTUS. SCENA PRIMA._


_Enter_ Goswin _and_ 4. Merchants.

_Gos._ Why gentlemen, 'tis but a week more, I intreat you
But 7. short days, I am not running from ye;
Nor, if you give me patience, is it possible
All my adventures fail; you have ships abroad
Endure the beating both of Wind and Weather:
I am sure 'twould vex your hearts, to be protested;
Ye are all fair Merchants.

_1 Mer._ Yes, and must have fair play:
There is no living here else; one hour's failing
Fails us of all our friends, of all our credits:
For my part, I would stay, but my wants tell me,
I must wrong others in't.

_Gos._ No mercy in ye!

_2 Mer._ 'Tis foolish to depend on others mercy:
Keep your self right, and even cut your cloth, Sir,
According to your calling, you have liv'd here,
In Lord-like Prodigality, high, and open,
And now ye find what 'tis: the liberal spending
The Summer of your Youth, which you should glean in,
And like the labouring Ant, make use and gain of,
Has brought this bitter, stormy Winter on ye,
And now you cry.

_3 Mer._ Alas, before your Poverty,
We were no men, of no mark, no endeavour;
You stood alone, took up all trade, all business
Running through your hands, scarce a Sail at Sea,
But loaden with your Goods: we poor weak Pedlers;
When by your leave, and much intreaty to it,
We could have stowage for a little Cloath,
Or a few Wines, put off, and thank your Worship.
Lord, how the World's chang'd with ye? now I hope, Sir,
We shall have Sea-room.

_Gos._ Is my misery
Become my scorn too! have ye no humanity?
No part of men left? are all the Bounties in me
To you, and to the Town, turn'd my reproaches?

_4 Mer._ Well, get your moneys ready: 'tis but 2 hours;
We shall protest ye else, and suddenly.

_Gos._ But two days.

_1 Mer._ Not an hour, ye know the hazard.     [_Exeunt._

_Gos._ How soon my light's put out! hard hearted _Bruges_!
Within thy Walls may never honest Merchant
Venture his fortunes more: O my poor Wench too.

_Enter_ Gerrard.

_Ger._ Good fortune, Master.

_Gos._ Thou mistak'st me, _Clause_,
I am not worth thy Blessing.

_Ger._ Still a sad man!

_Enter_ Higgen _and_ Prigg, _like_ Porters.
No belief gentle Master? come bring it in then,
And now believe your Beadsman.

_Gos._ Is this certain?
Or dost thou work upon my troubled sense?

_Ger._ 'Tis gold, Sir,
Take it and try it.

_Gos._ Certainly 'tis treasure;
Can there be yet this Blessing?

_Ger._ Cease your wonder,
You shall not sink, for ne'r a sowst Flap-dragon,
For ne'r a pickl'd Pilcher of 'em all, Sir,
'Tis there, your full sum, a hundred thousand crowns:
And good sweet Master, now be merry; pay 'em,
Pay the poor pelting Knaves, that know no goodness:
And chear your heart up handsomely.

_Gos._ Good _Clause_,
How cam'st thou by this mighty Sum? if naughtily,
I must not take it of thee, 'twill undo me.

_Ger._ Fear not, you have it by as honest means
As though your father gave it: Sir, you know not
To what a mass, the little we get daily,
Mounts in seven years; we beg it for Heavens charity,
And to the same good we are bound to render it.

_Gos._ What great security?

_Ger._ Away with that, Sir,
Were not ye more than all the men in _Bruges_;
And all the money in my thoughts--

_Gos._ But good _Clause_,
I may dye presently.

_Ger._ Then this dies with ye:
Pay when you can good Master, I'll no Parchments,
Only this charity I shall entreat you;
Leave me this Ring.

_Gos._ Alas, it is too poor, _Clause_.

_Ger._ 'Tis all I ask, and this withal, that when
I shall deliver this back, you shall grant me
Freely one poor petition.

_Gos._ There, I confirm it,      [_Gives the Ring._
And may my faith forsake me when I shun it.

_Ger._ Away, your time draws on. Take up the money,
And follow this young Gentleman.

_Gos._ Farewell _Clause_,
And may thy honest memory live for ever.

_Ger._ Heaven bless you, and still keep you, farewel Master.    [_Exeunt._




SCENE II.


_Enter_ Hubert.

_Hub._ I have lockt my Youth up close enough for gadding,
In an old Tree, and set watch over him.

_Enter_ Jaculin.

Now for my Love, for sure this Wench must be she,
She follows me; Come hither, pretty _Minche_.

_Jac._ No, no, you'll kiss.

_Hub._ So I will.

_Jac._ Y'ded law?
How will ye kiss me, pray you?

_Hub._ Thus, soft as my loves lips.

_Jac._ Oh!

_Hub._ What's your Father's name?

_Jac._ He's gone to Heaven.

_Hub._ Is it not _Gerrard_, Sweet?

_Jac._ I'll stay no longer;
My Mother's an old Woman, and my Brother
Was drown'd at Sea, with catching Cockles. O Love!
O how my heart melts in me: how thou fir'st me!

_Hub._ 'Tis certain she; pray let me see your hand, Sweet?

_Jac._ No, no, you'l bite it.

_Hub._ Sure I should know that Gymmal!

_Jac._ 'Tis certain he: I had forgot my Ring too.
O _Hubert_! _Hubert_!

_Hub._ Ha! methought she nam'd me--
Do you know me, Chick?

_Jac._ No indeed, I never saw ye;
But methinks you kiss finely.

_Hub._ Kiss again then;
By Heaven 'tis she.

_Jac._ O what a joy he brings me!

_Hub._ You are not _Minche_?

_Jac._ Yes, pretty Gentleman,
And I must be marry'd to morrow to a Capper.

_Hub._ Must ye my Sweet, and does the Capper love ye?

_Jac._ Yes, yes, he'I give me pie, and look in mine eyes thus.
'Tis he: 'tis my dear Love: O blest Fortune.

_Hub._ How fain she would conceal her self, yet shew it!
Will you love me, and leave that man? I'll serve.

_Jac._ O I shall lose my self!

_Hub._ I'll wait upon you,
And make you dainty Nose-gays.

_Jac._ And where will you stick 'em?

_Hub._ Here in [thy] bosom, Sweet, and make a crown of Lilies
For your fair head.

_Jac._ And will you love me deed-law?

_Hub._ With all my Heart.

_Jac._ Call me to morrow then,
And we'll have brave chear, and go to Church together:
Give you good ev'n Sir.

_Hub._ But one word fair _Minche_.

_Jac._ I must be gone a milking.

_Hub._ Ye shall presently.
Did you never hear of a young maid called _Jaculin_?

_Jac._ I am discover'd; hark in your ear, I'll tell ye:
You must not know me, kiss and be constant ever.

_Hub._ Heaven curse me else 'tis she, and now I am certain
They are all here: now for my other project--     [_Exeunt._




SCENE III.


_Enter_ Goswin, 4. Merchants, Higgen, _and_ Prigg.

_1 Mer._ Nay, if 'twould do you courtesie.

_Gos._ None at all, Sir:
Take it, 'tis yours, there's your ten thousand for ye,
Give in my Bills. Your sixteen.

_3 Mer._ Pray be pleas'd Sir
To make a further use.

_Gos._ No.

_3 Mer._ What I have, Sir,
You may command; pray let me be your Servant.

_Gos._ Put your Hats on: I care not for your courtesies,
They are most untimely done, and no truth in 'em.

_2 Mer._ I have a fraught of Pepper.

_Gos._ Rot your Pepper,
Shall I trust you again? there's your seven thousand.

_4 Mer._ Or if you want fine Sugar, 'tis but sending.

_Gos._ No, I can send to _Barbary_, those people
That never yet knew faith, have nobler freedoms:
These carry to _Vanlock_, and take my Bills in,
To _Peter Zuten_ these: bring back my Jewels,
Why are these pieces?

_Enter_ Sayler.

_Sayler._ Health to the noble Merchant,
The _Susan_ is return'd.

_Gos._ Well?

_Say._ Well, and rich Sir,
And now put in.

_Gos._ Heaven thou hast heard my prayers.

_Say._ The brave _Rebeccah_ too, bound from the Straits,
With the next Tide is ready to put after.

_Gos._ What news o'th' fly-boat?

_Say._ If this Wind hold till midnight,
She will be here, and wealthy, 'scap'd fairly.

_Gos._ How, prithee, Sayler?

_Say._ Thus Sir, she had fight
Seven hours together, with six Turkish Gallies,
And she fought bravely; but at length was boarded
And overlaid with strength: when presently
Comes boring up the wind Captain _Vannoke_,
That valiant Gentleman, you redeem'd from prison;
He knew the Boat, set in, and fought it bravely:
Beat all the Gallies off, sunk three, redeem'd her,
And as a service to ye sent her home Sir.

_Gos._ An honest noble Captain, and a thankfull;
There's for thy news: go drink the Merchants health, _Saylor_.

_Say._ I thank your bounty, and I'le do it to a doyt, Sir.
[_Exit_ Saylor.

_1 Mer._ What miracles are pour'd upon this fellow!

_Gos._ This here I hope, my friends, I shall scape prison,
For all your cares to catch me.

_2 Mer._ You may please Sir
To think of your poor servants in displeasure,
Whose all they have, goods, moneys, are at your service.

_Gos._ I thank you,
When I have need of you I shall forget you:
You are paid I hope.

_All._ We joy in your good fortunes.

_Enter_ Van-dunck.

_Van-d._ Come Sir, come take your ease, you must go home
With me, yonder is one weeps and howls.

_Gos._ Alas how does she?

_Van-d._ She will be better soon I hope.

_Gos._ Why soon Sir?

_Van-d._ Why when you have her in your arms, this night
My boy she is thy wife.

_Gos._ With all my heart I take her.

_Van-d._ We have prepar'd, all thy friends will be there,
And all my Rooms shall smoak to see the revel;
Thou hast been wrong'd, and no more shall my service
Wait on the knave her Uncle, I have heard all,
All his baits for my Boy, but thou shalt have her;
Hast thou dispatch't thy business?

_Gos._ Most.

_Van-d._ By the mass Boy,
Thou tumblest now in wealth, and I joy in it,
Thou art the best Boy, that _Bruges_ ever nourish'd.
Thou hast been sad, I'le cheer thee up with Sack,
And when thou art lusty I'le fling thee to thy Mistris.
She'I hug thee, sirrah.

_Gos._ I long to see it,
I had forgot you: there's for you my friends:
You had but heavy burthens; commend my love
To my best love, all the love I have
To honest _Clause_, shortly I will thank him better.     [_Exit._

_Hig._ By the mass a royal Merchant,
Gold by the handfull, here will be sport soon, _Prig._

_Prig._ It partly seems so, and here will I be in a trice.

_Hig._ And I boy,
Away apace, we are look'd for.

_Prig._ Oh these bak'd meats,
Me thinks I smell them hither.

_Hig._ Thy mouth waters.     [_Exeunt._




SCENA IV.


_Enter_ Hubert, _and_ Hemskirk.

_Hub._ I Must not.

_Hem._ Why? 'tis in thy power to do it, and in mine
To reward thee to thy wishes.

_Hub._ I dare not, nor I will not.

_Hem._ Gentle Huntsman,
Though thou hast kept me hard: though in thy duty,
Which is requir'd to do it, th' hast used me stubbornly;
I can forgive thee freely.

_Hub._ You the Earls servant?

_Hem._ I swear I am near as his own thoughts to him;
Able to doe thee--

_Hub._ Come, come, leave your prating.

_Hem._ If thou dar'st but try.

_Hub._ I thank you heartily, you will be
The first man that will hang me, a sweet recompence,
I could do, but I do not say I will,
To any honest fellow that would think on't,
And be a benefactor.

_Hem._ If it be not recompenc'd, and to thy own desires,
If within these ten days I do not make thee--

_Hub._ What, a false knave!

_Hem._ Prethee, prethee conceive me [rightly], any thing
Of profit or of place that may advance thee.

_Hub._ Why what a Goosecap would'st thou make me,
Do not I know that men in misery will promise
Any thing, more than their lives can reach at?

_Hem._ Believe me Huntsman,
There shall not one short syllable
That comes from me, pass
Without its full performance.

_Hub._ Say you so Sir?
Have ye e're a good place for my quality?

_Hem._ A thousand Chases, Forests, Parks: I'le make thee
Chief ranger over all the games.

_Hub._ When?

_Hem._ Presently.

_Hub._ This may provoke me: and yet to prove a knave too.

_Hem._ 'Tis to prove honest: 'tis to do good service,
Service for him thou art sworn to, for thy Prince,
Then for thy self that good; what fool would live here,
Poor, and in misery, subject to all dangers,
Law, and lewd people can inflict, when bravely
And to himself he may be law and credit?

_Hub._ Shall I believe thee?

_Hem._ As that thou holdst most holy.

_Hub._ Ye may play tricks.

_Hem._ Then let me never live more.

_Hub._ Then you shall see Sir, I will do a service
That shall deserve indeed.

_Hem._ 'Tis well said, Huntsman,
And thou shall be well thought of.

_Hub._ I will do it: 'tis not your setting free, for that's meer nothing,
But such a service, if the Earl be noble,
He shall for ever love me.

_Hem._ What is't Huntsman?

_Hub._ Do you know any of these people live here?

_Hem._ No.

_Hub._ You are a fool then: here be those, to have 'em,
I know the Earl so well, would make him caper.

_Hem._ Any of the old Lords that rebel'd?

_Hub._ Peace, all,
I know 'em every one, and can betray 'em.

_Hem._ But wilt thou doe this service?

[_Hub._] If you'l keep
Your faith, and free word to me.

_Hem._ Wilt thou swear me?

_Hub._ No, no, I will believe ye: more than that too,
Here's the right heir.

_Hem._ O honest, honest huntsman!

_Hub._ Now, how to get these Gallants, there's the matter,
You will be constant, 'tis no work for me else.

_Hem._ Will the Sun shine again?

_Hub._ The way to get 'em.

_Hem._ Propound it, and it shall be done.

_Hub._ No sleight;
(For they are Devilish crafty, it concerns 'em,)
Nor reconcilement, (for they dare not trust neither)
Must doe this trick.

_Hem._ By force?

_Hub._ I, that must doe it.
And with the person of the Earl himself,
Authority (and mighty) must come on 'em:
Or else in vain: and thus I would have ye do it.
To morrow-night be here: a hundred men will bear 'em,
(So he be there, for he's both wise and valiant,
And with his terrour will strike dead their forces)
The hour be twelve a Clock, now for a guide
To draw ye without danger on these persons,
The woods being thick, and hard to hit, my self
With some few with me, made unto our purpose,
Beyond the wood, upon the plain, will wait ye
By the great Oak.

_Hem._ I know it: keep thy faith huntsman,
And such a showr of wealth--

_Hub._ I warrant ye:
Miss nothing that I tell ye.

_Hem._ No.

_Hub._ Farewel;
You have your liberty, now use it wisely;
And keep your hour, goe closer about the wood there,
For fear they spy you.

_Hem._ Well.

_Hub._ And bring no noise with ye.
[_Exit._

_Hem._ All shall be done to th' purpose: farewel hunts-man.

_Enter_ Gerrard, Higgen, Prig, Ginks, Snap, Ferret.

_Ger._ Now, what's the news in town?

_Ginks._ No news, but joy Sir;
Every man wooing of the noble Merchant,
Who has his hearty commendations to ye.

_Fer._ Yes this is news, this night he's to be married.

_Ginks._ By th' mass that's true, he marrys _Vandunks_ Daughter,
The dainty black-ey'd bell.

_Hig._ I would my clapper
Hung in his baldrick, a what a peal could I Ring?

_Ger._ Married?

_Ginks._ 'Tis very true Sir, O the pyes,
The piping-hot mince-pyes!

_Prig._ O the Plum-pottage!

_Hig._ For one leg of a goose now would I venture a limb boys,
I love a fat goose, as I love allegiance,
And------upon the Boors, too well they know it,
And therefore starve their poultry.

_Ger._ To be married
To _Vandunks_ Daughter?

_Hig._ O this [pretious] Merchant:
What sport he will have! but hark you brother _Prig_,
Shall we do nothing in the foresaid wedding?
There's mony to be got, and meat I take it,
What think ye of a morise?

_Prig._ No, by no means,
That goes no further than the street, there leaves us,
Now we must think of something that must draw us
Into the bowels of it, into th' buttery,
Into the Kitchin, into the Cellar, something
That that old drunken Burgo-master loves,
What think ye of a wassel?

_Hig._ I think worthily.

_Prig._ And very fit it should be, thou, and _Ferret_,
And _Ginks_ to sing the Song: I for the structure,
Which is the bowl.

_Hig._ Which must be up-sey _English_,
Strong, lusty _London_ beer; let's think more of it.

_Ger._ He must not marry.

_Enter_ Hubert.

_Hub._ By your leave in private,
One word Sir, with ye; _Gerrard_: do not start me,
I know ye, and he knows ye, that best loves ye:
_Hubert_ speaks to ye, and you must be _Gerrard_.
The time invites you to it.

_Ger._ Make no show then,
I am glad to see you Sir; and I am _Gerrard_.
How stand affairs?

_Hub._ Fair, if ye dare now follow,
_Hemskirk_ I have let goe, and these my causes,
I'le tell ye privately, and how I have wrought him,
And then to prove me honest to my friends,
Look upon these directions, you have seen his.

_Hig._ Then will I speak a speech, and a brave speech
In praise of Merchants, where's the Ape?

_Prig._ ------ Take him,
A gowty Bear-ward stole him the other day.

_Hig._ May his Bears worry him, that Ape had paid it,
What dainty tricks! ------ O that bursen Bear-ward:
In his French doublet, with his blister'd bullions,
In a long stock ty'd up; O how daintily
Would I have made him wait, and shift a trencher,
Carry a cup of wine? ten thousand stinks
Wait on thy mangy hide, thou lowzy Bear-ward.

_Ger._ 'Tis passing well, I both believe and joy in't,
And will be ready: keep you here the mean while,
And keep in, I must a while forsake ye,
Upon mine anger no man stir, this two hours.

_Hig._ Not to the wedding Sir?

_Ger._ Not any whither.

_Hig._ The wedding must be seen sir; we want meat too.
We are horrible out of meat.

_Prig._ Shall it be spoken,
Fat Capons shak't their tails at's in defiance?
And turkey tombs such honorable monuments,
Shall piggs, Sir, that the Parsons self would envy,
And dainty Ducks--

_Ger._ Not a word more, obey me.
[_Exit_ Ger.

_Hig._ Why then come dolefull death, this is flat tyranny,
And by this hand--

_Hub._ What?

_Hig._ I'le goe sleep upon't.
[_Exit_ Hig.

_Prig._ Nay, and there be a wedding, and we wanting,
Farewel our happy days: we do obey Sir.     [_Exeunt._




SCENA V.


_Enter two young_ Merchants.

_1 Mer._ Well met Sir, you are for this lusty wedding.

_2 Mer._ I am so, so are you I take it.

_1 Mer._ Yes,
And it much glads me, that to doe him service
Who is the honour of our trade, and lustre,
We meet thus happily.

_2 Mer._ He's a noble fellow,
And well becomes a bride of such a beauty.

_1 Mer._ She is passing fair indeed, long may their loves
Continue like their youths, in spring of sweetness,
All the young Merchants will be here
No doubt on't,
For he that comes not to attend this wedding,
The curse of a most blind one fall upon him,
A loud wife, and a lazie: here's _Vanlock_.

_Enter_ Vanlock _and_ Francis.

_Vanl._ Well overtaken Gentlemen: save ye.

_1 Mer._ The same to you sir; save ye fair Mistris _Francis_,
I would this happy night might make you blush too.

_Vanl._ She dreams apace.

_Fran._ That's but a drowsie fortune.

_3 Mer._ Nay take us with ye too; we come to that end,
I am sure ye are for the wedding.

_Vanl._ Hand and heart man:
And what their feet can doe, I could have tript it
Before this whorson gout.

_Enter_ Clause.

_Clau._ Bless ye Masters.

_Vanl._ _Clause_? how now _Clause_? thou art come to see thy Master,
(And a good master he is to all poor people)
In all his joy, 'tis honestly done of thee.

_Clau._ Long may he live sir, but my business now is
If you would please to doe it, and to him too.

_Enter_ Goswin.

_Vanl._ He's here himself.

_Gos._ Stand at the door my friends?
I pray walk in: welcom fair Mistris _Francis_,
See what the house affords, there's a young Lady
Will bid you welcom.

_Vanl._ We joy your happiness.
[_Exeunt._

_Gos._ I hope it will be so: _Clause_ nobly welcom,
My honest, my best friend, I have been carefull
To see thy monys--

_Clau._ Sir, that brought not me,
Do you know this Ring again?

_Gos._ Thou hadst it of me.

_Cla._ And do you well remember yet, the boun you gave me
Upon the return of this?

_Gos._ Yes, and I grant it,
Be it what it will: ask what thou canst, I'le do it;
Within my power.

_Cla._ Ye are not married yet?

_Gos._ No.

_Cla._ Faith I shall ask you that that will disturb ye,
But I must put ye to your promise.

_Gos._ Do,
And if I faint and flinch in't--

_Cla._ Well said Master,
And yet it grieves me too: and yet it must be.

_Gos._ Prethee distrust me not.

_Cla._ You must not marry,
That's part of the power you gave me: which to make up,
You must presently depart, and follow me.

_Gos._ Not marry, _Clause_?

_Cla._ Not if you keep your promise,
And give me power to ask.

_Gos._ Pre'thee think better,
I will obey, by Heaven.

_Cla._ I have thought the best, Sir

_Gos._ Give me thy reason, do'st thou fear her honesty?

_Cla._ Chaste as the ice, for any thing I know, Sir.

_Gos._ Why should'st thou light on that then? to what purpose?

_Cla._ I must not now discover.

_Gos._ Must not marry?
Shall I break now when my poor heart is pawn'd?
When all the preparation?

_Cla._ Now or never.

_Gos._ Come, 'tis not that thou would'st: thou do'st but fright me.

_Cla._ Upon my soul it is, Sir, and I bind ye.

_Gos._ _Clause_, can'st thou be so cruel?

_Cla._ You may break, Sir,
But never more in my thoughts appear honest.

_Gos._ Did'st ever see her?

_Cla._ No.

_Gos._ She is such a thing,
O _Clause_, she is such a wonder, such a mirror,
For beauty, and fair vertue, _Europe_ has not:
Why hast thou made me happy, to undo me?
But look upon her; then if thy heart relent not,
I'le quit her presently: who waits there?

_Ser._ [_within_] Sir.

_Gos._ Bid my fair love come hither, and the Company.
Prethee be good unto me; take a mans heart
And look upon her truly: take a friends heart
And feel what misery must follow this.

_Cla._ Take you a noble heart and keep your promise;
I forsook all I had, to make you happy.

_Enter_ Gertrude, Vandunk, _and the rest_ Merchants.

Can that thing call'd a Woman, stop your goodness?

_Gos._ Look there she is, deal with me as thou wilt now,
Did'st ever see a fairer?

_Cla._ She is most goodly.

_Gos._ Pray ye stand still.

_Ger._ What ails my love?

_Gos._ Didst thou ever,
By the fair light of Heave[n], behold a sweeter?
O that thou knew'st but love, or ever felt him,
Look well, look narrowly upon her beauties.

_1 Mer._ Sure h'as some strange design in hand, he starts so.

_2 Mer._ This Beggar has a strong power over his pleasure.

_Gos._ View all her body,

_Cla._ 'Tis exact and excellent.

_Gos._ Is she a thing then to be lost thus lightly?
Her mind is ten times sweeter, ten times nobler,
And but to hear her speak, a Paradise,
And such a love she bears to me, a chaste love,
A vertuous, fair, and fruitful love: 'tis now too
I am ready to enjoy it; the Priest ready, _Clause_,
To say the holy words shall make us happy,
This is a cruelty beyond mans study,
All these are ready, all our joyes are ready,
And all the expectation of our friends,
'Twill be her death to do it.

_Cla._ Let her dye then.

_Gos._ Thou canst not: 'tis impossible.

_Cla._ It must be.

_Gos._ 'Twill kill me too, 'twill murder me: by heaven _Clause_
I'le give thee half I have; come thou shalt save me.

_Cla._ Then you must go with me: I can stay no longer,
If ye be true, and noble.

_Gos._ Hard heart, I'le follow:
Pray ye all go in again, and pray be merry,
I have a weighty business, (give my Cloak there,)

_Enter_ Servant (_with a Cloak._)

Concerns my life, and state, (make no enquiry,)
This present hour befaln me: with the soonest
I shall be here again: nay pray go in, Sir,
And take them with you, 'tis but a night lost, Gentlemen.

_Van._ Come, come in, we will not lose our meat yet,
Nor our good mirth, he cannot stay long from her,
I am sure of that.

_Gos._ I will not stay; believe, Sir.     [_Exit._

_Gertrude_, a word with you.

_Ger._ Why is this stop, Sir?

_Gos._ I have no more time left me, but to kiss thee,
And tell thee this, I am ever thine: farewel wench.     [_Exit._

_Ger._ And is that all your Ceremony? Is this a wedding?
Are all my hopes and prayers turn'd to nothing?
Well, I will say no more, nor sigh, nor sorrow;
Till to thy face I prove thee false. Ah me!     [_Exit._




_ACTUS QUINTUS. SCENA PRIMA._


_Enter_ Gertrude, _and a_ Boor.

_Ger._ Lead, if thou thinkst we are right: why dost thou make
These often stands? thou saidst thou knewst the way.

_Bo._ Fear nothing, I do know it: would 'twere homeward.

_Ger._ Wrought from me by a Beggar? at the time
That most should tye him? 'tis some other Love
That hath a more command on his affections,
And he that fetcht him, a disguised Agent,
Not what he personated; for his fashion
Was more familiar with him, and more powerful
Than one that ask'd an alms: I must find out
One, if not both: kind darkness be my shrowd,
And cover loves too curious search in me,
For yet, suspicion, I would not name thee.

_Bo._ Mistris, it grows somewhat pretty and dark.

_Ger._ What then?

_Bo._ Nay, nothing; do not think I am afraid,
Although perhaps you are.

_Ger._ I am not, forward.

_Bo._ Sure but you are? give me your hand, fear nothing.
There's one leg in the wood, do not pull me backward:
What a sweat one on's are in, you or I?
Pray God it do not prove the plague; yet sure
It has infected me; for I sweat too,
It runs out at my knees, feel, feel, I pray you.

_Ger._ What ails the fellow?

_Bo._ Hark, hark I beseech you,
Do you hear nothing?

_Ger._ No.

_Bo._ List: a wild Hog,
He grunts: now 'tis a Bear: this wood is full of 'em,
And now, a Wolf, Mistress, a Wolf, a Wolf,
It is the howling of a Wolf.

_Ger._ The braying of an Ass, is it not?

_Bo._ Oh, now one has me;
Oh my left haunch, farewel.

_Ger._ Look to your Shanks,
Your Breech is safe enough, the Wolf's a Fern-brake.

_Bo._ But see, see, see, there is a Serpent in it;
It has eyes as broad as Platters; it spits fire;
Now it creeps towards us, help me to say my Prayers:
It hath swallowed me almost, my breath is stopt;
I cannot speak: do I speak Mistress? tell me.

_Ger._ Why, thou strange timerous Sot, canst thou perceive
Any thing i'th' Bush but a poor Glo-worm?

_Bo._ It may be 'tis but a Glo-worm now, but 'twill
Grow to a Fire-drake presently.

_Ger._ Come thou from it:
I have a precious guide of you, and a courteous,
That gives me leave to lead my self the way thus.

_Bo._ It thunders, you hear that now?

_Ger._ I hear one hollow.

_Bo._ 'Tis thunder, thunder:
See, a Flash of Lightning:
Are you not blasted Mistress? pull your Mask off,
It has plaid the Barber with me here: I have lost
My Beard, my Beard, pray God you be not shaven,
'Twill spoil your Marriage Mistress.

_Ger._ What strange Wonders
Fear fancies in a Coward!

_Bo._ Now the Earth opens.

_Ger._ Prithee hold thy peace.

_Bo._ Will you on then?

_Ger._ Both love and jealousie have made me bold,
Where my Fate leads me, I must go.     [_Exit._

_Bo._ God be with you then.

_Enter_ Woolfort, Hemskirk, _and_ Attendants.

_Hem._ It was the Fellow sure, he that should guide me,
The Hunts-man that did hollow us.

_Woolf._ Best make a stand,
And listen to his next: Ha!

_Hem._ Who goes there?

_Bo._ Mistress, I am taken.

_Hem._ Mistress? Look forth Souldiers.

_Woolf._ What are you Sirrah?

_Bo._ Truly all is left
Of a poor Boor, by day-light, by night no body,
You might have spar'd your Drum, and Guns, and Pikes too
For I am none that will stand out Sir, I.
You may take me in with a walking Stick,
Even when you please, and hold me with a packthred.

_Hem._ What woman was't you call'd to?

_Bo._ Woman! none Sir.

_Woolf._ None! did you not name Mistress?

_Bo._ Yes, but she's
No woman yet: she should have been this night,
But that a Beggar stole away her Bridegroom,
Whom we were going to make hue and cry after;
I tell you true Sir, she should ha' been married to day;
And was the Bride and all; but in came _Clause_,
The old lame Beggar, and whips up Mr _Goswin_
Under his arm; away with him as a Kite,
Or an old Fox would swoop away a Gosling.

_Hem._ 'Tis she, 'tis she, 'tis she: Niece?

_Ger._ Ha!

_Hem._ She Sir,
This was a noble entrance to your fortune,
That being on the point thus to be married,
Upon her venture here, you should surprise her.

_Woolf._ I begin, _Hemskirk,_ to believe my fate,
Works to my ends.

_Hem._ Yes Sir, and this adds trust
Unto the fellow our guide, who assur'd me _Florez_
Liv'd in some Merchants shape, as _Gerrard_ did
I' the old Beggars, and that he would use
Him for the train, to call the other forth;
All which we find is done--That's he again--     [_Holla again._

_Woolf._ Good, we sent out to meet him.

_Hem._ Here's the Oak.

_Ger._ I am miserably lost, thus faln
Into my Uncles hands from all my hopes,
Can I not think away my self and dye?

_Enter_ Hubert, Higgen, Prig, Ferret, Snap, Ginks _like_ Boors.

_Hub._ I like your habits well: they are safe, stand close.

_Hig._ But what's the action we are for now? Ha!
Robbing a Ripper of his Fish.

_Prig._ Or taking
A Poulterer Prisoner, without ransome, Bullyes?

_Hig._ Or cutting off a Convoy of Butter?

_Fer._ Or surprizing a Boors ken, for granting cheats!

_Prig._ Or cackling Cheats?

_Hig._ Or Mergery-praters, Rogers,
And Tibs o'th' Buttery?

_Prig._ O I could drive a Regiment
Of Geese afore me, such a night as this,
Ten Leagues with my Hat and Staff, and not a hiss
Heard, nor a wing of my Troops disordered.

_Hig._ Tell us,
If it be milling of a lag of duds,
The fetching of a back of cloaths or so;
We are horribly out of linnen.

_Hub._ No such matter.

_Hig._ Let me alone with the Farmers dog,
If you have a mind to the cheese-loft; 'tis but thus,
And he is a silenc'd Mastiff, during pleasure.

_Hub._ Would it would please you to be silent.

_Hig._ Mum.

_Woolf._ Who's there?

_Hub._ A friend, the Hunts-man.

_Hem._ O 'tis he.

_Hub._ I have kept touch Sir, which is the Earl of these?
Will he know a man now?

_Hem._ This my Lord's the Friend,
Hath undertook the service.

_Hub._ If't be worth
His Lordships thanks anon, when 'tis done
Lording, I'll look for't, a rude Wood-man,
I know how to pitch my toils, drive in my game:
And I have don't, both _Florez_ and his Father
Old _Gerrard_, with Lord _Arnold_ of _Benthuisen_,
_Cozen_, and _Jaculin_, young _Florez_'s Sister:
I have 'em all.

_Woolf._ Thou speak'st too much, too happy,
To carry faith with it.

_Hub._ I can bring you
Where you shall see, and find 'em.

_Woolf._ We will double
What ever _Hemskirk_ then hath promis'd thee.

_Hub._ And I'll deserve it treble: what horse ha' you?

_Woolf._ A hundred. That's well: ready to take
Upon surprise of 'em.

_Hem._ Yes.

_Hub._ Divide then
Your force into five Squadrons; for there are
So many out-lets, ways through the wood
That issue from the place where they are lodg'd:
Five several ways, of all which Passages,
We must possess our selves, to round 'em in;
For by one starting hole they'll all escape else:
I and 4. Boors here to me will be guides,
The Squadron where you are, my self will lead:
And that they may be more secure, I'll use
My wonted whoops, and hollows, as I were
A hunting for 'em; which will make them rest
Careless of any noise, and be a direction
To the other guides, how we approach 'em still.

_Woolf._ 'Tis order'd well, and relisheth the Souldier;
Make the division _Hemskirk_; you are my charge,
Fair One, I'll look to you.

_Boo._ Shall no body need
To look to me? I'll look unto my self.

_Hub._ 'Tis but this, remember.

_Hig._ Say, 'tis done, Boy.     [_Exeunt._




SCENA II.


_Enter_ Gerrard _and_ Florez.

_Ger._ By this time Sir I hope you want no reasons
Why I broke off your marriage, for though I
Should as a Subject study you my Prince
In things indifferent, it will not therefore
Discredit you, to acknowledge me your Father,
By harkning to my necessary counsels.

_Flo._ Acknowledge you my Father? Sir I do,
And may impiety, conspiring with
My other Sins, sink me, and suddenly
When I forget to pay you a Sons duty
In my obedience, and that help'd forth
With all the cheerfulness.

_Ger._ I pray you rise,
And may those powers that see and love this in you,
Reward you for it: Taught by your example
Having receiv'd the rights due to a Father,
I tender you th' allegeance of a Subject:
Which as my Prince accept of.

_Flo._ Kneel to me?
May mountains first fall down beneath their valleys,
And fire no more mount upwards, when I suffer
An act in nature so preposterous;
I must o'ercome in this, in all things else
The victory be yours: could you here read me,
You should perceive how all my faculties
Triumph in my blest fate, to be found yours;
I am your son, your son Sir, and am prouder
To be so, to the Father, to such goodness
(Which heaven be pleas'd, I may inherit from you)
Than I shall ever of those specious titles
That plead for my succession in the Earldom
(Did I possess it now) left by my Mother.

_Ger._ I do believe it: but--

_Flo._ O my lov'd Father,
Before I knew you were so, by instinct,
Nature had taught me, to look on your wants,
Not as a stranger's: and I know not how,
What you call'd charity, I thought the payment
Of some religious debt, nature stood bound for;
And last of all, when your magnificent bounty
In my low ebb of fortune, had brought in
A flood of blessings, though my threatning wants
And fear of their effects, still kept me stupid,
I soon found out, it was no common pity
That led you to it.

_Ger._ Think of this hereafter
When we with joy may call it to remembrance,
There will be a time, more opportune, than now
To end our story, with all circumstances,
I add this only: when we fled from _Wolfort_
I sent you into _England_, and there placed you
With a brave _Flanders_ Merchant, call'd rich _Goswin_,
A man supplyed by me unto that purpose,
As bound by oath never to discover you,
Who dying, left his name and wealth unto you
As his reputed Son, and yet receiv'd so;
But now, as _Florez_, and a Prince, remember
The countreys, and the subjects general good
Must challenge the first part in your affection:
The fair maid, whom you chose to be your wife,
Being so far beneath you, that your love
Must grant she's not your equal.

_Flo._ In descent
Or borrowed glories from dead Ancestors,
But for her beauty, chastity, and all vertues
Ever remembred in the best of women,
A Monarch might receive from her, not give,
Though she were his Crowns purchase; in this only
Be an indulgent Father: in all else,
Use your authority.

_Enter_ Hubert, Hemskirk, Wolfort,
Bertha, _and_ Souldiers.

_Hub._ Sir, here be two of 'em,
The Father and the Son, the rest you shall have
As fast as I can rouze them.

_Ger._ Who's this? _Wolfort_?

_Wol._ I Criple, your feigned crutches will not help you,
Nor patch'd disguise that hath so long conceal'd you,
It's now no halting: I must here find _Gerrard_,
And in this Merchants habit, one call'd _Florez_
Who would be an Earl.

_Ger._ And is, wert thou a subject.

_Flo._ Is this that Traitor _Wolfort_?

_Wol._ Yes, but you
Are they that are betrai'd: _Hemskirk_.

_Ber._ My _Goswin_
Turn'd Prince? O I am poorer by this greatness,
Than all my former jealousies or misfortunes.

_Florez._ _Gertrude_?

_Wol._ Stay Sir, you were to day too near her,
You must no more aim at those easie accesses,
Less you can do't in air, without a head,
Which shall be suddenly tri'd.

_Ber._ O take my heart, first,
And since I cannot hope now to enjoy him,
Let me but fall a part of his glad ransom.

_Wol._ You know not your own value, that entreat.

_Ger._ So proud a fiend as _Wolfort_.

_Wol._ For so lost
A thing as _Florez_.

_Flo._ And that would be so
Rather than she should stoop again to thee;
There is no death, but's sweeter than all life,
When _Wolfort_ is to give it: O my _Gertrude_,
It is not that, nor Princedom that I goe from,
It is from thee, that loss includeth all.

_Wol._ I, if my young Prince knew his loss, he would say so,
Which that he yet may chew on, I will tell him
This is no _Gertrude_, nor no _Hemskirks_ Niece,
Nor _Vandunks_ Daughter: this is _Bertha_, _Bertha_,
The heir of _Brabant_, she that caus'd the war,
Whom I did steal, during my treaty there,
In your minority, to raise my self;
I then fore-seeing 'twould beget a quarel,
That, a necessity of my employment,
The same employment, make me master of strength,
That strength, the Lord of _Flanders_, so of _Brabant_,
By marrying her: which had not been to doe Sir,
She come of years, but that the expectation
First of her Fathers death, retarded it,
And since the standing out of _Bruges_, where
_Hemskirk_ had hid her, till she was near lost:
But Sir, we have recover'd her: your Merchantship
May break, for this was one of your best bottoms
I think.

_Ger._ Insolent Devil!

_Enter_ Hubert, with Jaqueline, Ginks,
_and_ Costin.

_Wol._ Who are these, _Hemskirk_?

_Hem._ More, more, Sir.

_Flo._ How they triumph in their treachery!

_Hem._ Lord _Arnold_ of _Benthusin_, this Lord _Costin_,
This _Jaqueline_ the sister unto _Florez_.

_Wol._ All found? why here's brave game, this was sport royall,
And puts me in thought of a new kind of death for 'em.
Hunts-man, your horn: first wind me _Florez_ fall,
Next _Gerrards_, then his Daughter _Jaquelins_,
Those rascals, they shall dye without their rights:
Hang 'em _Hemskirk_ on these trees; I'le take
The assay of these my self.

_Hub._ Not here my Lord,
Let 'em be broken up upon a scaffold,
'Twill shew the better when their arbour's made.

_Ger._ Wretch, art thou not content thou hast betrai'd us,
But mock us too?

_Ginks._ False _Hubert_, this is monstrous.

_Wol._ _Hubert_?

_Hem._ Who, this?

_Ger._ Yes this is _Hubert_, _Wolfort_,
I hope he has helpt himself to a tree.

_Wol._ The first,
The first of any, and most glad I have you Sir,
I let you goe before, but for a train;
Is't you have done this service?

_Hub._ As your Hunts-man,
But now as _Hubert_; save your selves, I will,
The _Wolf's_ afoot, let slip; kill, kill, kill, kill.

_Enter with a drum_ Van-dunk, Merchants,
Higgen, Prig, Ferret, Snap.

_Wol._ Betray'd?

_Hub._ No, but well catch'd: and I the Huntsman.

_Van-d._ How do you _Wolfort_? Rascal, good knave _Wolfort_,
I speak it now without the Rose, and _Hemskirk_,
Rogue _Hemskirk_, you that have no niece, this Lady
Was stoln by you, and ta'ne by you, and now
Resign'd by me, to the right owner here:
Take her my Prince.

_Flo._ Can this be possible,
Welcom my love, my sweet, my worthy love.

_Van-d._ I ha' giv'n you her twice: now keep her better, and thank
Lord _Hubert_, that came to me in _Gerrards_ name,
And got me out, with my brave Boyes, to march
Like _Caesar_, when he bred his Commentaries,
So I, to bread my Chronicle, came forth
_Caesar Van-dunk_, & _veni, vidi, vici_,
Give me my Bottle, and set down the drum;
You had your tricks Sir, had you? we ha' tricks too,
You stole the Lady?

_Hig._ And we led your Squadrons,
Where they ha' scratch'd their leggs a little, with brambles,
If not their faces.

_Prig._ Yes, and run their heads
Against trees.

_Hig._ 'Tis Captain _Prig_, Sir.

_Prig._ And Coronel _Higgen_.

_Hig._ We have fill'd a pit with your people, some with leggs,
Some with arms broken, and a neck or two
I think be loose.

_Prig._ The rest too, that escap'd,
Are not yet out o'the briars,

_Hig._ And your horses, Sir,
Are well set up in _Bruges_ all by this time:
You look as you were not well Sir, and would be
Shortly let blood; do you want a scarf?

_Van-d._ A halter.

_Ger._ 'Twas like your self, honest, and noble _Hubert_:
Can'st thou behold these mirrors all together,
Of thy long, false, and bloody usurpation?
Thy tyrrannous proscription, and fresh treason:
And not so see thy self, as to fall down
And sinking, force a grave, with thine own guilt,
As deep as hell, to cover thee and it?

_Wol._ No, I can stand: and praise the toyles that took me
And laughing in them dye, they were brave snares.

_Flo._ 'Twere truer valour, if thou durst repent
The wrongs th' hast done, and live.

_Wol._ Who, I repent?
And say I am sorry? yes, 'tis the fool's language
And not for _Wolfort_.

_Van-d._ _Wolfort_, thou art a Devil,
And speakst his language, oh that I had my longing
Under this row of trees now would I hang him.

_Flo._ No let him live, until he can repent,
But banish'd from our State, that is thy doom.

_Van-d._ Then hang his worthy Captain here, this _Hemskirk_
For profit of th' example.

_Flo._ No let him
Enjoy his shame too: with his conscious life,
To shew how much our innocence contemns
All practice from the guiltiest, to molest us.

_Van-d._ A noble Prince.

_Ger._ Sir, you must help to join
A pair of hands, as they have done their hearts here,
And to their loves with joy.

_Flo._ As to mine own,
My gracious Sister, worthiest Brother.

_Van._ I'le go afore, and have the bon-fire made,
My fire-works, & flap dragons, and good backrack,
With a peck of little fishes, to drink down
In healths to this day.

_Hig._ 'Slight, here be changes,
The Bells ha' not so many, nor a dance, _Prig_.

_Prig._ Our Company's grown horrible thin by it,
What think you _Ferret_?

_Fer._ Marry I do think,
That we might all be Lords now, if we could stand for't.

_Hig._ Not I if they should offer it: I'le dislodge first,
Remove the Bush to another climat.

_Ger._ Sir, you must thank this worthy _Burgomaster_,
Here be friends ask to be look'd on too,
And thank'd, who though their trade, and course of life
Be not so perfect, but it may be better'd,
Have yet us'd me with courtesy, and been true
Subjects unto me, while I was their King,
A place I know not well how to resign,
Nor unto whom: But this I will entreat
Your grace, command them follow you to _Bruges_;
Where I will take the care on me, to find
Some manly, and more profitable course
To fit them, as a part of the Republique.

_Flo._ Do you hear Sirs? do so.

_Hig._ Thanks to your good grace.

_Prig._ To your good Lordship.

_Fer._ May you both live long.

_Ger._ Attend me at _Van-dunks_, the _Burgomasters_.

[_Ex. all but Beggars._

_Hig._ Yes, to beat hemp, and be whipt twice a week,
Or turn the wheel, for Crab the Rope-maker:
Or learn to go along with him, his course;
That's a fine course now, i' the common-wealth, _Prig_,
What say you to it?

_Prig._ It is the backwardst course,
I know i'the world.

_Hig._ Then _Higgen_ will scarce thrive by it,
You do conclude?

_Prig._ 'Faith hardly, very hardly.

_Hig._ Troth I am partly of your mind, Prince _Prig_;
And therefore farewel _Flanders_, _Higgen_ will seek
Some safer shelter, in some other Climat,
With this his tatter'd Colony: Let me see
_Snap_, _Ferret_, _Prig_, and _Higgen_, all are left
O' the true blood: what? shall we into _England_?

_Prig._ Agreed.

_Hig._ Then bear up bravely with your _Brute_ my lads,
_Higgen_ hath prig'd the prancers in his dayes,
And sold good penny-worths; we will have a course,
The Spirit of _Bottom_, is grown bottomless.

_Prig._ I'le mand no more, nor cant.

_Hig._ Yes, your sixpenny worth
In private, Brother, sixpence is a sum
I'le steal you any mans Dogg for.

_Prig._ For sixpence more
You'l tell the owner where he is.

_Hig._ 'Tis right,
_Higgen_ must practise, so must _Prig_ to eat;
And write the Letter: and gi' the word. But now
No more, as either of these.

_Prig._ But as true Beggars,
As e're we were.

_Hig._ We stand here, for an Epilogue;
Ladies, your bounties first; the rest will follow;
For womens favours are a leading alms,
If you be pleas'd look cheerly, throw your eyes
Out at your masks.

_Prig._ And let your beauties sparkle.

_Hig._ So may you ne'er want dressings, Jewels, gowns
Still i' the fashion.

_Prig._ Nor the men you love,
Wealth nor discourse to please you.

_Hig._ May you Gentlemen,
Never want good fresh suits nor liberty.

_Prig._ May every Merchant here see safe his ventures.

_Hig._ And every honest Citizen his debts in.

_Prig._ The Lawyers again good Clyents.

_Hig._ And the Clyents good Counsel.

_Prig._ All the Gamesters here good fortune.

_Hig._ The Drunkards too good wine.

_Prig._ The eaters meat
Fit for their tastes and palats.

_Hig._ The good wives kind Husbands.

_Prig._ The young maids choyce of Sutors.

_Hig._ The Midwives merry hearts.

_Prig._ And all good cheer.

_Hig._ As you are kind unto us and our Bush,
We are the Beggars and your daily Beadsmen,
And have your mony, but the Alms we ask
And live by, is your Grace, give that, and then
We'l boldly say our word is, _Come again_.

BEGGARS BUSH.

(A) The First Folio, 1647.

(B) The | Beggars | Bush. | Written by | Francis Beaumont, And John
Fletcher, Gentlemen. | [wood-cut] London, | Printed for Humphrey Robinson,
and Anne Mosely, | at the three Pigeons, and at the Princes Arms | in
Saint Pauls Church-yard, 1661.

Another issue of the above, dated 1661, has a fresh title-page and bears
the following notice:--'You may speedily expect those other Playes, which
| Kirkman, and his Hawkers have deceived the | buyers withall, selling
them at treble the value, that | this and the rest will be sold for, which
are the | onely Originall and corrected copies, as they | were first
purchased by us at no mean | rate, and since printed by us.'

B prints the Prologue and Epilogue to _The Captaine_ as though they
belonged to _Beggars Bush_, apparently treating the last page of _The
Captain_ in A as though it were the first page of _Beggars Bush_.

_Ger_. Now sweare him.

_Hig_. You are welcom Brother.

Of this fellow?

_Hub_. Thank ye friends,
And I beseech ye, if you dare but trust me;
For if I have kept wilde doggs and beastes for wonder,
And made 'em tame too: give into my custody
This roaring rascal I shall hamper him,
With all his knacks and knaveryes, and I feare me
Discover yet a further villany in him;
O he smells ranck 'oth rascall.

_Ger_. Take him to thee,
But if he scape--

_Hub_. Let me be ev'n hang'd for him,
Roome Sir, I'le tye ye to my leash.

_Hem_. Away Rascall.

_Hub_. Be not so stubborne: I shall swindge ye soundly,
And ye play tricks with me.

_Ger_. Now sweare him.

_Hig_. I crowne thy nab, with a gag of benbouse,
And stall thee by the salmon into the clowes,
To mand on the pad, and strike all the cheates;
To mill from the Ruffmans, commision and slates,
Twang dell's, i'the stiromell, and let the Quire Cuffin:
And Herman Beck strine, and trine to the Ruffin.

_Ger_. Now interpret this unto him.

_Hig_. I poure on thy pate a pot of good ale,
And by the Rogues oth a Rogue thee install:
To beg on the way, to rob all thou meetes;
To steale from the hedge, both the shirt and the sheets:
And lye with thy wench in the straw till she twang,
Let the Constable, Justice, and Divell go hang.

_Ger_. So, now come in,
But ever have an eye Sir, to your prisoner.

_Hub_. He must blinde both mine eyes, if he get from me.

_Ger_. Go, get some victualls, and some drink, some good drink
For this day weele keep holly to good fortune,
Come and be frollick with us.

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
